                                                       Patient Name: ROBISON,NEIL [ MRN: 013423CA ]

                                                         Date of Visit: 04/27/81









Mr. Robison comes to clinic today for f/u after being hospitalized for central pontine CVA in early April.  He has been working with OT, speech therapy and nutrition at home, with some improvement in gait and fine motor skills.  He still feels like his speech is poor and his right hand is not working at baseline.  Other complaints include a HA every morning which is global and tends to improve over the course of the day with tylenol.  He does admit to some visual changes that have been occuring for about one year--transient decreased vision in right eye, lasting for several minutes to hours and happening about twice per week.  He saw an ophthamologist in 12/02 who, per the patient, found no abnormalities.  He also states that he has had nonproductive cough with chest congestion for about 2 weeks. No fevers, chills, n/v or diarrhea.  Some rhinorrhea but no sinus sxs.  He has had difficulty with muscle cramps since his BMT which respond well to gatorade.  The nutritionist is not thrilled with the high salt content of gatorade.  We discussed the possibility of drinking less gatorade and adding a banana daily. 



MEDS:

lopressor 25 TID

coumadin 5 QHS



PE: 97.1   66   144/90, repeat 130/90    wt 225

gen: NAD, slightly dysarthric

neuro: CNII-XII intact except for slight right mouth droop; strength is 5/5 both upper and lower extremities; biceps and patellar DTRs 2+ symmetrically; gait is steady, but heel to toe is unsteady

CV: distant RRR without murmurs

Pulm: soft bibasilar crackles; no wheezes, rhonchi or areas of consolidation. no dullness to percussion

Skin: flaking over forehead and nasal bridge with slight redness

Rectal: erythema perirectally without bleeding or hemorrhoids. sl decreased rectal tone, no tenderness guaic neg brown stool







Labs: 4/22 INR 2.8

4/26: CBC, Chem 7, coags pending



A/P: 53 yo man with h/o lymphoma s/p allo BMT in 10/78 c/b chronic skin GVHD, pseudomonal pna and post herpetic neuralgia who was recently hospitalized with central pontine CVA.  Trans thoracic echo, spiral CT and carotid ultrasound did not reveal embolic source.  MRI showed right MCA cut off with collateral flow.  His sxs of dysarthria and right hand dysfunction seem to be slowly improving with OT, speech therapy. Daily HA are concerning.  

--repeat head CT to rule out progression of infarct or bleed into infarct territory. Pt may need another MRI in future, but is wary of MRI and may require open machine

--pt has neuro follow up at the end of May.  We need to discuss with the neurologist the duration of anti-coagulation

--check coags, CBC, Chem 7 today; adjust coumadin prn

--increase lopressor to 50 BID and continue BP monitoring by VNA

--pt has f/u with his primary oncologist Dr. Savage at RGSC on 5/6. 

--no abx at this time for cough without focal pulm findings and abscence of fever. Follow closely

--have asked pt to make another ophtho appt to eval visual changes in right eye (which apparently have been happening for a year and have not been progressive)

--RTC in 3 weeks to review CT results and lab tests.

Re:   Neil Robison  #371-97-98



Dear Wilcox,



     I saw Mr. Robison today. I hadn't seen him since last year.  I'm very pleased to see how well he's done.  He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth.  His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged).  He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet.  There is no tremor.  His arms and legs are strong.  Extraocular movements are full.  The pupils are equal.  There is no ptosis.  His speech is fluent.



     He takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).  



     His blood pressure is 120/80.  The pulse is around 76.  There are no cervical bruits.  



     From my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight.  I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery. The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded.  The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging.  It may well be occluded with collateralization. The left imaging was in 2082.  He is stable at this time.  He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.



Best regards,





G. Kevin Yawn, M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Neil comes in today to follow up on multiple medical issues, the first of which is his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He states that since beginning the Flomax that we started him on in January, his symptoms are at least 50% better.  He is only getting up once per night to go to the bathroom and is not having any hesitancy or difficulty passing his urine.  He is also following up on his elevated cholesterol, his hypertension.  He states that he has been trying to follow a better diet, but does state that he has not been particularly good about getting regular exercise.  He is also following up on his diabetes.  He is not having any difficulty with his medications.  He did not schedule his colonoscopy that I had referred him for in January but states that he would be willing to do so after the spring.  He is also following up on his COPD.  He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis.  He states that his breathing has been good.  He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.  He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.  A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.  He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting.  He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.

MEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection.  The oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities show no edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.  He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.  He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
2.  BPH.  We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.  Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
3.  Hypertension.  This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.  If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
4.  COPD.  Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.  He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
5.  Elevated cholesterol.  His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.  If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
6.  Abnormal liver function tests.  These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.  It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.  Follow up with me is in one month.
