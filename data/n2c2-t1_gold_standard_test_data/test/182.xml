EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
68yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until 2/12.
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)
DISPO: PT, OT, SLP eval

Attending: Cotton
PCP: Trahan
Code Status:  FULL

CC:  Pre-CABG

HPI: 
68y M s/p recent NAMC hospitalization after having a vfib arrest at the mall on 02/04/33, with defibrillation x 5 in the field (3x by bystanders, and 2x by EMS). Pt converted to NSR in the field. He was stabilized at Blakely House, then transferred to NAMC. At NAMC, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and Dr. Albright   s team was consulted. As pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to Fremont Medical Center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. At FMC, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy. He is transferred back to NAMC today in preparation for CABG, planned 3/07/33.

Color Flow    Doppler    TTE

-Technically Difficult Study-

Sub optimal parasternal images.

MITRAL VALVE
There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence
of mitral valve prolapse.  There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation by
color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM
The left atrium is dilated.

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT
Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic
valve is tricuspid.  There is evidence of trace aortic insufficiency by color
and spectral Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE
The left ventricular cavity size is dilated.  The left ventricular systolic
function is moderately impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic
with regional variation.  The estimated ejection fraction is 35 %.

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.
There is an insufficient tricuspid regurgitation Doppler profile to estimate
an RV systolic pressure.

RIGHT VENTRICLE
The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function
is within normal limits.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

2/11/33 Left Heart Cath
1) Three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The Left Main is large and has only mild irregularities.  The LAD is
diffusely diseased (30 - 40%) and has a distal 80% stenosis.  The Left Cx is
totally occluded The LCx receives faint collaterals from the LAD territority.
The ramus branch has diffuse disease with a 80% proximal stenosis and a 70% mid
stenosis.  The RCA is occluded proximally and there are right to right
collaterals. There are 80% mid and 80% distal stenoses in the RCA.
2) LV gram shows EF of 30%, with anterior/apical akinesis and inferior
hypokinesis.
3) Right dominant system

EKG: 
Admission (no recent EKG available for comparison upon admit)
NSR @ 66, LAD, IVCD (QRS 114) with partial LBBB morphology, PRWP, nonspecific STTW changes (inverted I, II, L).
