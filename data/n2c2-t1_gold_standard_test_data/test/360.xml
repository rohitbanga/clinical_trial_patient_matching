Mr. Geiger is a 74 year old man who comes in today for follow up of his 
blood pressure medication as well as his cholesterol level.  I have been 
readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia 
several months ago.  His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d. and atenolol 25mg q.d.  He apparently went 
to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
to have high blood pressure.  She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
from 25mg to 50mg.  He has not yet completed that prescription.  Mr. 
Geiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.  He denies any recent chest 
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.  

Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly 
elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.  His 
current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, 
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, dysuria.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.  His weight is 184.  
His heart rate is 80.  Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no 
murmurs.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Extremities show no evidence of 
edema.  

Recent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, 
chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  He has a 
normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.  His T4 is 
normal at 10.3.  His THBR is normal at 0.98.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1.   Hypertension.  Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated 
     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.  
     He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.  
     I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a 
     few weeks for blood pressure check.  
2.   Cholesterol.  The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.  
     Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 
     130.  Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.  His current 
     liver function tests are normal.

3.   Health maintenance.  I have recommended to him losing some weight.  
     He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month.  He attributes 
     this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of 
     exercise.  I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him.  
     He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last 
     week.

Mr. Geiger is a 75 year old man with a history of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia and panhypopituitarism who comes in today for 
follow up of his blood pressure.  We have been titrating up his 
blood pressure meds over the past week.  He is gone from 50mg of 
atenolol to 75 to 100mg with steady improvement in his blood 
pressure.  His current regimen is atenolol 100q.d., HCTZ 25 q.d., 
lisinopril 20mg q.d.  The patient has had no dizziness or other 
symptoms with increasing doses of atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 160/94.  Heart rate 
is 64.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Lungs clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  Cardiac exam: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, 
S2 with no murmurs.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities: no edema.  

Laboratories:  Cholesterol from June 11, 2077: total 171, HDL 57, 
LDL 86. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Geiger is a very pleasant 75 year old 
man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
1. 	Hypertension.  Blood pressure still elevated.  I will increase 
lisinopril to 30mg q.d.  Will also check a set of electrolytes 
at his next visit in 2 weeks when his blood pressure will be 
followed up.
2. 	Cholesterol.  Well controlled at this time.
3. 	Health maintenance.  The patient denies any colonoscopy in the 
past.  I do not see one on record or in his history.  We will 
arrange a screening colonoscopy.  The patient has had recent 
PSA of 2.8 and a normal prostate exam by me last year.  He is 
due for annual physical next month and will schedule this.

null                                           03/13/79


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a known history of
hypopituitarism and hypertension who comes in today for routine
annual exam.  He states that he has been feeling exceptionally
well.  No history of chest pain, angina, dyspnea on exertion,
shortness of breath, abdominal complaints.  No difficulties in
bowel habits, melena, BRBPR.  No prostatic symptoms of urinary
hesitancy or slow stream.  He states that he has been carefully
taking his prednisone and testosterone as prescribed, as well as
his blood pressure medicines including lisinopril 40 q.d.,
atenolol 75 q.d., and his cholesterol medicine 10 of Lipitor q.d.
 He is no longer taking the hydrochlorothiazide that was
prescribed to him in the past.  He also states that he has run
out of Synthroid and has not been taking that for the past
several weeks.

The patient states that he is staying active, getting some
exercise, continues to abstain from smoking or drinking, and has
an appropriate diet.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On full review of systems, he denies any
current concerns except for occasional difficulty maintaining an
erection, which he states is not a significant problem for him.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 q.d., testosterone q.3. weeks,
prednisone 5 mg q.a.m. 2.5 mg q.p.m., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., and 
atenolol 75 mg q.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Panhypopituitarism secondary to
macroadenoma resection and hypertension.

HEALTH MAINTENANCE:  Last cholesterol level 06/2077, total 171
with an HDL of 57 and LDL of 86.  The patient has not had a prior
colonoscopy.  Last PSA was less than assay 1 year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well appearing, in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure elevated at 170/84, heart rate 60.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Fundi are benign.  Oropharynx is clear.  Tympanic
membranes are clear.  Neck:  Shows no lymphadenopathy, no
thyromegaly.  He does have a 3 x 3 cm cyst on his posterior neck
that seems to be a lipoma.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac: 
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, positive S4, 1/6 systolic
murmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Midline scar status post some type
of cord resection.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Aorta is nonpalpable. 
There are no renal bruits.  Femoral arteries are without bruits. 
GU:  Testicles appear normal.  Penis appears normal.  Rectal: 
Guaiac negative brown stool.  Prostate is smooth and nonenlarged.
 Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Normal sensation
to vibratory in the feet.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old
man who is overall doing extremely well except for his
hypertension which is poorly controlled.  I am unclear as to why
he stopped his hydrochlorothiazide, but I think that this should
be restarted as we do not have any further room with his
lisinopril or atenolol.  He will begin at 25 mg q.d.  I will have
his electrolytes checked today and come back and see me in 2
weeks' time for a repeat electrolyte check as well as blood
pressure check, and further medication adjustment if necessary. 
We will also check urinalysis for protein as well as an EKG at
this time given his hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  We will recheck cholesterol today.

Panhypopituitarism.  He seems to be doing well on his medications
except that he stopped his TSH dose for unclear reasons.  I have
instructed him to restart his Synthroid and given him new
prescriptions.  We will recheck thyroid panel at this time.

Health maintenance.  We will check a PSA and schedule a
colonoscopy today.

He will return to clinic in 2 weeks' time for a BP check.
