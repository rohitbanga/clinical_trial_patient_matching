ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
44M with ESRD on HD presents with N/V.  His symptoms appear to be resolving and this may represent a viral gastroenteritis, as his cardiac enzymes are negative and sugars have been well-controlled since presentation to ED.  He may have an element of diabetic gastroparesis given his medication list.  We will add amylase and lipase to his bloodwork to r/o pancreatitis.  Consider AXR to r/o constipation (normally on lactulose).

Plan:
1.  HD today as per usual schedule and prescription.  Hold Epo given Hct elevated.
2.  Will draw blood Cx x 2, iron studies, 25OH Vitamin D, PTH in HD.
3.  Start Nephrocaps.
4.  CAD risk:  Start ASA 81mg qd.
5.  Polypharmacy:  On multiple antihypertensives at different doses.  Would d/c enalapril and losartan.  Use only lisinopril daily (titrate up as needed), but ask patient to take meds after dialysis on dialysis days.
6.  Social work to see (already informed).

EDVISIT^47646361^JAY, COREY^01/29/65^TOMLIN, THEODORE

The patient was seen on 01/29/2065.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  "Foot infection."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old man

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, blood sugars in the

140s this week, chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis

secondary to diabetes who had a bilateral TMA who presents with 3

days of right heel ulcer, discharge and foul smelling order.  No

erythema.  The patient had decreased sensation in bilateral feet

secondary to diabetic neuropathy.  He denies nausea, vomiting,

fevers, abdominal pain, cough, shortness breath, or chest pain. 

The patient is blind and speaks Spanish.  He also has a history

of hypertension.

The rest of the past medical history, social history, family

history, surgical history, review of systems, allergies, and

medications as per the resident's note.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.2, pulse 78, respiratory

rate 20, blood pressure is 201/104, and saturation 99% on room

air.  General:  No apparent distress, cooperative.  HEENT: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were bilateral cataract

blindness.  Conjunctivae were clear.  Oral mucosa was moist. 

Neck is supple.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no

wheezes or crackles.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No

murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Good bowel sounds,

nondistended, nontender, and soft.  Extremity exam:  No ankle

edema, calf tenderness, or asymmetry.  Musculoskeletal

examination:  The patient has bilateral TMA.  Skin exam:  The

patient has dry gauze at soles of his bilateral feet; however, he

has a 1 cm diameter ulceration in the heel of his right foot that

is crusty and has some yellowish discharge on gauze.  It indeed

has foul odor.  It is nontender.  Neurological examination: 

Motor strength 5/5 throughout all extremities.  Sensation

decreased bilateral feet, to the ankles.  Rest of the lower

extremities were intact to light touch and symmetrical.  Vascular

examination 2+ radial and DP pulses.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  A 46-year-old man diabetic with

foul smelling foot ulcer.  Possible diagnoses is cellulitis, soft

tissue infection, or osteomyelitis.  The patient's WBC was 6.2. 

Hematocrit and platelets were normal.  He was slightly dry.  His

BUN was 40.  His creatinine of 7.4; however, it was decreased

from his hemodialysis yesterday.  Sodium was 139, potassium was

5.0.  An x-ray of his foot of the right did not reveal any

osteomyelitis; however, given his four smelling odor and

yellowish discharge on his dressing, we elected to treat him with

3.375 mg of Zosyn.  He also received Tylenol for some pain.  The

patient blood pressure remained high and at one point it was

232/109.  He received 10 mg of hydralazine, 10 mg of labetalol IV

as well as 100 mg of labetalol p.o.  The patient's blood pressure

went down to 140/82 prior to admission.  The patient's primary

care physician was called who agreed with the admission to the

Medical Service.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Diabetic foot ulcers.

2.  Hypertension.

CC: 
LLQ pain


HPI: 
Mr. Jay is a 48yo with type II DM c/b diabetic retinopathy, ESRD on HD, bilateral TMA, and HTN who presents with LLQ pain x2 days.
Mr. Jay was seen in the ED the day prior to admission with the same complaint of new onset LLQ pain, which was sharp, non radiating, and most painful with inspiration.  He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED.  He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED.  Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2/2 to throacic radiculopathy/neuropathy 2/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain.  He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication.  Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED.  He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling.  Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.  


On presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA.  He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way).  Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day.  Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction.  However, patient was given dulcolax PR.  He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.
