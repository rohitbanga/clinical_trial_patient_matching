Reason for visit:

   Mr. Cortez is seen in follow up for ASMI, sleep apnea, coronary risk factors, glucose intolerance, obesity.



Interval History:

   The patient relates that he's been feeling reasonably well.  He complains of lightheadedness when he lies down which is lasting only seconds and disappears the instant he puts his head on his pillow.  He took one TNG over the past 6 months for indigestion like sensation.



He doesn't have any exertional syndrome to suggest angina.



No syncope, pre-syncope.  No palpitations, no recent weight loss.







Social history:

   Continues to work.  Looking forward to Spring work in his garden.

Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Cortez is doing reasonably well.  



I think it would be reasonable to obtain a stress test because he is not significantly active, has glucose intolerance and should be periodically screened for coronary artery disease progression.



LDL goal should be 60-80 and Lipitor is increased to 20mg hs in this regard.



BP goal should be 120 systolic and Lisinopril is increased to 20mg from 10mg in this regard,.



He is strongly encouraged to pursue weightloss this Spring.

Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology for followup on coronary artery disease.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been followed here by Dr.  Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm.  He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that.  He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds.  He says that most of this is because of inactivity.  He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.



Past medical history:

   Significant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.



Current Medications:

  Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

 Plavix 75 mg qd

 aspirin 325 mg qd

 Prilosec 20 mg qd

 Toprol XL 25 mg qd

 nitroglycerin PRN



Family history:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Social history:

   He is retired.  He lives in Barnstable.  He likes to work in his yard.  He quit smoking several years ago.



Review of systems:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-BP: 130/70  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Mildly overweight

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

Echocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo.  which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.  There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.

Stress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080. He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate.  There was no evidence of ischemia.  There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct.



EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI.



Selected recent labs:

 The patient's last blood work was 08/17/2080 and at that time his BUN was 9, creatinine 0.8, potassium was 3.8, blood glucose 145, cholesterol was 96, triglycerides 70, HDL 42, and LDL 40.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a big anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago.  He has had stenting of his coronaries in 2076.  He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time.  He has a fairly good LV function.  There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix.  He is on a good medical regimen.  Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.  He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.  He does have some trace pedal edema.  His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.  I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today.  My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.  Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.

Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.  His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.  He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.  Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.  He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.  He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.  He is no longer using a CPAP.



Current Medications:

  aspirin 325 mg qd

 Diovan 80 mg qd

 Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   80 and regular

-BP: 135/90  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a mildly overweight white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Oriented x 3

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

	

Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.  concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.

Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.  Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.  Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.  The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.



	EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.



	Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution. There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique. I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease. Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm. We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.
