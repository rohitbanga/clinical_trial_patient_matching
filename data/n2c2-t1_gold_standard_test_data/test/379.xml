Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine

693-31-18-1



I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.  The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.



He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.  In August he suffered a stroke.  He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.  He recalls no problem with his vision.  He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.  He does no know the extent of the evaluation.  He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.  He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.  His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.  He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.  He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.  The dizziness is worst in the morning.  He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.



He has DM and HTN.  He is a nonsmoker.  I don't have cholesterol information.  There is no history of cardiac disease.  There is no history of alcohol abuse.



He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.  He has no known allergies.



He is aware of no significant family history.



He is married.  He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.  He came to america from Honduras in 2073.  He worked nights in construction until his stroke.



Pulse 66, regular.  BP 186/110.  There are no cranial bruits.  The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.  He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.  His fluency in his native language is probably normal.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.  (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  The tone is only mildly increased.  Sensation is intact.  Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  He wears a right AFO.  He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.



His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.



To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.  I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.  He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.  I asked him to return here in a month to review this.





Sincerely,







Patrick Winn, M.D.

							Nancy-Jasmine, Nikkolas 
							69331181
							05/24/92 


The patient is a 67-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and 
history of recent stroke who comes in for follow up and for 
evaluation of positive PPD.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He was being evaluated for day 
program and in the course of this had a PPD placed which was 
positive.  He has no history of prior TB testing.  He has had no 
chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, weight 
loss or night sweats.  He has had no known exposure to TB.  

He is being treated for hypertension which has been difficult to 
control but seems recently to be doing quite well on a 
combination of HCTZ 12.5mg, metoprolol 50mg b.i.d., Norvasc 10mg 
PO q.d., Zestril 20mg PO q.d.  Today's blood pressure was 
terrific at 128/70.  

He has diabetes and his hemoglobin A1C came down from 10.4 in 
February to 7.9 in May.  He had been started in February on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. and seems to e tolerating it quite 
well.  

He did have a stroke in August 2091 with right-sided hemiparesis.  
He is able to walk to the bathroom with a cane but otherwise uses 
a wheelchair.  He had a form for me to complete for a day program 
listing his typical functioning.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished, 
pleasant man.  Weight was not done.  Blood pressure 128/70.  
HEENT: throat clear.  Neck supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  
No carotid bruits.  No JVD.  Heart: no murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  
Extremities: no edema.  Neuro: he has weakness in the right leg 
and arm. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. 	Positive PPD.  At the time of this dictation, his chest x-ray 
came back and is completely normal.  Given his age and unknown 
duration of his positive PPD, will not treat.  
2. 	Hypertension.  Doing well on current combination of 
medications.
3. 	Diabetes, doing much better since he started Glucophage.  At 
his next visit, I will need to confirm when his last eye 
appointment was.  
4. 	Status post CVA.  He seems to be functioning well.

male who presents with slurred speech.  The patient has a history 

of a prior cerebrovascular accident with residual right sided 

deficit.  One day prior to arrival, the patient was found to have 

increasing slurring of speech and he was found to increasing 

weakness over his baseline on the right side.  The patient arrives 

without acute complaints except for difficulty speaking.  He denies 

any headache.  He also does complain of some throat pain. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is as per the written note.  

The patient denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath 

or dysphagia.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is 

significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular 

accident and otherwise as per the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Tylenol, aspirin, 

Avenida, Glucophage, Zoloft, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and 

otherwise as per the written note.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's social history 

and family history are as per the written note and are significant 

for past tobacco use and no alcohol use.  He lives with family and 

goes to a day care facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient is a well nourished 

male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97, pulse 62, 

respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 163/96, oxygen saturation 100% 

on room air.  NECK:  Supple with full range of motion.  No nuchal

auscultated.  NEUROLOGIC:  Alert, oriented x 3, dysarthric.  Finger 

to nose is within normal limits bilaterally.  There is 5/5 motor 

strength throughout the left upper extremity and left lower 

extremity.  The right upper extremity and right lower extremity 

there is 3/5 motor strength throughout all motor groups tested.  

The patient is able to follow all commands.  His ability to 

understand appears to be completely intact.  

Further details of the patient's physical examination are as per 

the written note.

CXR: clear

CT head: bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts

CTA: pending	

MRI/MRA:	pending

Assessment: 68yo RHM with history of bilateral thalamocapsular infarcts and multifocal stenoses of vessels of Circle of Willis, with prior symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait instability, here in the setting of medication noncompliance, hypertensive and hyperglycemic, with 1 week of recurrent symptoms. Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait. Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits. However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.

Plan:   

-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis

Check MRI brain stroke protocol

Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180

Control hyperglycemia

If stroke present, admit to Neurology.

R/O MI



Discussed with Dr. Costello.

 

Thank you for this interesting consult.
