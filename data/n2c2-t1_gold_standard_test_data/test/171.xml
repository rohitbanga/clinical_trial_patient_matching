NAME:     Usrey, John 

MRN:       6762675



This is a 76-year-old man who comes in with a chief complaint of left calf pain. 

This occurs after walking about one block and pain is sufficient to prevent him

from walking further.  He will then stop, pain will disappear.  He will continue

walking at which time it will occur at about the same distance.  There is no rest

pain.  The pain had been present for a couple of months although it has been

increasing in severity.   



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for intracranial bleed secondary to an

AV malformation.  He refused surgery at that time at Campellton-Graceville Hospital and has done

well on Dilantin without any seizures.  There has been no further bleed or problem

from this malformation.  He also has treated hypothyroidism.  He is status post

TURP, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy.  He does have a chronic anxiety

disorder for which he is on Ativan intermittently.  He also has pustular psoriasis.



MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 600 mg per day, which keeps his level at about 7.  At

these levels he has had no seizures.  He is also on Synthroid at 0.075 per day.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a mostly German-speaking man.  There is a

right-sided tremor which has been present since his intracranial bleed.  Neck

supple.  Blood pressure is at 140/80.  Weight 184.  Heart rate is at 70.  There are

no carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular without gallop or murmur. 

Abdominal exam - No mass, tenderness, or organomegaly.  There are multiple

scars. There is a bruit over the right femoral artery with a decreased pulsation there

compared to the left.  There is no pulse palpable below popliteal on the right side. 

There is no visible ischemic change of the right leg.  The left femoral is fuller, and

there is a palpable dorsalis pedis on that side.  



IMPRESSION:  Peripheral vascular disease, probably right iliofemoral.  He will

undergo arteriovascular studies.  He will also be placed on aspirin at 81 mg per

day.  In addition he is begun on Lipitor 10 mg per day for hyperlipidemia.  He will

follow up following that vascular study.  This evaluation was also communicated to

her daughter, Quinn, because of the language barrier.

NAME:     Usrey, John  

MRN:        6762675



Patient presents for follow-up visit after long hospitalization. He went in to have an

AAA repair and suffered a postop MI. He was in CCU for 3-4 weeks at which time

he sustained a Pseudomonas pneumonia, small bowel obstruction, and PE. He

subsequently had his CABG done at the end of April and was discharged at the end

of May to Grant Clinic. He did well at Grant Clinic and was discharged

from there on the 10th of June, and he presents to me for follow-up today. 



He states that he feels well. He denies any chest pain or trouble breathing since

discharge. He does not remember anything from his hospitalization otherwise. He is

mentally intact. He reports that he has not had a bowel movement for 3 days and had

some pain a couple of days ago. He is passing gas, last done yesterday. No dysuria.

His daughter reports that he is eating well, that he is at his baseline mental status,

that he has had not had any acute complaints at home. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. Also, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder

due to a congenital AVM, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease.



ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 q.d., atenolol 25 b.i.d., Zocor 20 q.h.s.,

Carafate 1 gm p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 10 q.d., multivitamins, thiamine 100 q.d., Seroquel

37.5 q.h.s. and 12.5 q.a.m., Flomax 0.8 q.d., Synthroid 100 q.d., Dilantin 150 p.o. t.i.d.,

Colace 100 t.i.d. 



VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 112/52. Pulse 72. Weight 162. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: General - Elderly male in no acute distress. Appears well in

consideration of his recent long hospitalization. Neck - No JVD or bruits noted

bilaterally. Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rales. CV -

RRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds heard in all 4

quadrants, although mildly decreased. Soft, mildly distended. No masses. No HSM.

No fluid wave. Extremities - He has 1+ firm pitting edema to his mid-shin. 



LABS: From June 13, 2091, show CBC with white count of 4.4, hemoglobin 11.2,

hematocrit 32.2. Chem 7 - BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, glucose 203, Dilantin 5.6. 



ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 76-year-old male, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post CABG in April as

well as AAA repair returns after an extended hospitalization with complications of

pneumonia, SBO, and PE who comes in for follow-up visit. Despite everything,

patient looks well. 



(1)  CV. Will continue cardiac medications at this time. Will likely change Zocor

     back to Lipitor but will check his labs first. Patient would benefit from cardiac

     rehab at this time. He is scheduled to see Dr. Nutter at the end of this

     month. Will arrange for him to have regular cardiac care after this. He has

     seen Dr. Quesnel for his postop CABG issues.



(2)  PVD. Patient status post AAA repair. He has seen Dr. Uddin and is doing

     well. 



(3)  Neuro. Patient on Dilantin 150 t.i.d. as per Dr. Acuna. It would be okay to

     decrease him to 100 t.i.d. as he was before. Will check  his levels today but

     likely decrease to 100 t.i.d. Will refer back to Dr. Acuna for follow-up. 



(4)  Endocrine. Will check TSH. Likely will continue current Levoxyl dose.



(5)  Osteoporosis. Okay to restart Fosamax.



(6)  GI. Patient with constipation. He can start Citrucel or Metamucil twice a day.

     Can also use Dulcolax daily until he has a bowel movement and then decrease

     to every other day as needed. Can also adjust fiber therapy as needed.

     Instructed patient and daughter that if patient is passing gas, it is okay.

     However, if he stops, they should call immediately. 



(7)  Psych. They should continue Celexa and Seroquel for now. Will review charts

     from Grant Clinic to see why medications were started and will likely

     taper him off them.



In general, need to review records from Grant Clinic in order to see what

happened there. Will consider that in my recommendations for his further care.

Return to clinic in 2 weeks.

HPI: This is a 84M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in 2091 who presents via transfer from Waverly urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia. The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.



On presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. 



Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently.
