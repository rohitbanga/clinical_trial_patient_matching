                     BHC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

MARVINYANDELL,GRACE   904-68-07-1              VISIT DATE: 08/06/96

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 

woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 

episode on the premises.  A code was called when bystanders and 

medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.  The 

patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 

Emergency Department. 

The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.  She took her 

medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 

nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.  Her 

other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.  No epigastric 

pain or tenderness and no chest pain.  The patient never had any 

chest pain prior to her event.  She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 

significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 

migraines. 

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 

Calan slow release and Glucophage. 

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 

Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.  LUNGS: 

Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 

murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal. 

GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 

was 160.  Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 

leads.  No significant ST elevations. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 

year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 

premises.  A code was called overhead.  Bystanders reported that 

the patient was diaphoretic.  They gave her something to drink. 

Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.  The patient has no 

complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She looks well 

but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 

or gallops on her electrocardiogram.  The patient was made NPO 

because of her cystoscopy procedure. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES: 

1.  Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 

diabetes medicine this morning. 

2.  PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.  No 

old electrocardiogram to compare.  We need to address the PR 

depressions.  This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.  I 

would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis. 

3.  Cardiac ischemia. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 

need admission and a formal rule out.  She may even need an 

echocardiogram inpatient.  A full work up is pending.  The 

patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 

Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

Gibson Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell
MRN:  8099832
ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
PCP:  unknown

CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital

HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.  At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.   As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.

Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.  Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.  During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.

At present, pt. c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.  She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.  

Hospital Course: 
MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt. was started on IV vancomycin.  The bacteremic source remains unclear.  TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.  A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.  Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.  A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
Back pain: Pt. c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.  Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.  An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.  The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.  No epidural extension was noted.  There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.  Pt. received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.  As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.  A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.  A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.    A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.  Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.  
Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  
Renal failure:  Pt. developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.  Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.  Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.  
Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.  She was started on procrit by hematology.  She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
TIA:  Pt. has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.  An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.  This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.  A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.  No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.  
HTN: Pt. required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.

LABS PENDING

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Hospital following a syncopal event on 7/30/02.  Found to have a MRSA bacteremia with an unidentified source, lesions at T10/T11 on spinal MRI, and continued c/o back pain and nausea.

Back pain: MRI of T spine with abnl and prior percutaneous bx non-diagnostic.  Differential dx includes metastatic disease vs. infection.  Neurosurgery  consulted at San Rafael who felt it to be a high risk procedure and tx here for further mngmt.  MRI read at MSRH indicated that lesion was more consistent with malignancy than infection.
-re-read of OSH studies by radiologists at GCH
-IR guided bone bx as per IR
-neurosurgery if IR unable to biopsy
-dilaudid 1-3 mg IV q4hours, reglan and zofran prn nausea
-consider pain consult

2.    ID:  Staph bacteremia at OSH, TTE and TEE showed no vegetations indicating that endocarditis is not the source, R. knee aspiration also negative.   Pt. has now completed 4 weeks antibiotics with renal failure during course of vancomycin.
d/c vancomycin
con to monitor fever curve
if osteomyelitis found on bx, will need further course of antibiotics
blood cx x2 now, and reculture if febrile
ongoing nausea and vomiting: consider non contrast head CT to r/o septic emboli, pt has had multiple MRIs at OSH
held erythromycin 250 mg PO bid, pt reportedly takes it as prophylaxis for R. arm cellulites, consider restarting
heart murmur heard on PE, not documented in prior notes; consider re-echoing pt here

Breast mass: As per San Rafael, mass on R. breast is likely due to thickening s/p lumpectomy thirty years ago.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  
-consider biopsy of R. breast mass now that bacteremia resolved

Renal:  s/p acute renal failure while on vancomycin, recheck creatinine and hold vanco for now
-f/u creatinine

HTN: At San Rafael, bp medications adjusted.  Restarted on same medications here.  
-cont to monitor
-adjust as needed


FEN: soft mechanical diet


PROPHYLAXIS
GI: none, consider nexium

Record date: 2102-12-01
ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.



HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.  Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.  Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.  Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.  She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.



In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.    She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.  She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.   Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.  She was transferred to GCH in August.   She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.  She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.  She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.



She was discharged to rehab in mid September.  She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.  She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.  She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.  She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.  The arm swelling quickly resolved. There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.  She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.



MEDS:  Coumadin 7.5 mg qd,  Norvasc 10 mg qd, Isordil 20 mg tid, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po qd, Prilosec 20 mg qd, Folic aid 1 mg qd, Synthroid 50 mcg qd, Labetolol 200 mg bid, Glipizide 2.5 mg po qd, Albuterol inhaler prn, erytab 250 bid, Ultram 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, Vitamin B12 1000. Rhinocort Aqua, Nitrostat prn,  Was d'cd from Reglan, taking Donperdon?



PE:  WDWN BF NAD  Wt 135 lbs  BP 100/64



Heent:  throat clear,  EOMI. Perrl.

Neck:  supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.

Cor:  RRR, no m's.

Lungs; clear.

Abdomen;  soft, nontender no HSM.

Extr;  no edema.



A/P:  74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, s/p 5 month hospitalization.



1)  Diabetes.  Throughout her hospitalization she lost a lot of weight down from 160's to 170's last spring to current level of 135 lbs.  Insulin was stopped and just recently Glipizide 2.5 mg added on.  Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on 12/04/02 was 6.0.  Bun /Cr was 11/0.9.  glucose 196.  Cholesterol 225/68/135.  LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.  If normalized then will add back Lipitor.  History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.



2)  Hypertension.  Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.



3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.  Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.  With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.  She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.  INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.



4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.  Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.



5)  History of hypothyroidism.  Had recent labs at SRH on  12/04/02 with TSH of 1.3 and Free T4 of  0.9.  



6)  History of anemia, requiring Procrit and ? transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of 41.1 on  12/04/02.



7)  Neuro;  History of partial seizures, TIA's.  Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes.    History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.    History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ? TIA left hemisphere, ? repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.  On Plavix and coumadin.  Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.



8)  History of elevated LFT's.  May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.  Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.

Internal Medicine Admission Note

PATIENT: 	Grace Marvin Yandell
MRN:  		8099832
ADMIT DATE:  7/28/03
ATTENDING:	WINTERS

CC:  
Syncope

HPI: 
Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.

Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099. She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. She was started on Depakote for this. Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.   In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.  

Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.  When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.  These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.  Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.  She does not recall the events herself.  The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).  The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.

In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.  She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management. 

The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.  Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.  The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.  She denies fevers/chills.  No chest pain, palpitations.  Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.  Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.  She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.

EKG: Sinus at 86.  Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.

CXR 7/28: NAD

Chest CT 4/03: 
IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
     apex. Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
     tiny lung nodules seen.

MRI 9/02
     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
     ischemia.  There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
     hole or craniotomy.  There are chronic appearing, small right
     cerebellar infarcts.  There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
     with small vessel ischemic change.  There is FLAIR hyperintensity
     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
     parietal and left occipital lobes.  No abnormal enhancement is
     seen.  The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
     unremarkable.  The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
     There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.  There is
     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  There are
     bilateral lens implants.  The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
     otherwise unremarkable.
     MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
     posterior cerbral artery.  There is diffuse irregularity of the
     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.  There is moderate
     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.  The
     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.  There is
     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
     the circle of Willis.
     Impression:
     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
     predominance as described.  This could represent hemorrhage, high
     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
     injection.
     Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.  Diffuse irregularity
     of the left posterior cerebral artery.  These findings could be
     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
     vasculitis is another possibility.
     Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
     No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
     Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
     Small vessel ischemic changes.

Carotid US 3/02
IMPRESSIONS:
1. RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS.
2. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
3. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
4. BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.

Echo    01
1.  Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.  Left ventricular
    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.  There is no flattening of the
    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
    arterial pressure.  There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
2.  There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
    There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
    represent atherosclerotic change. 
3.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.  There is no evident aortic stenosis
    or aortic insufficiency.  Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.  Otherwise,
    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.  Normal appearing tricuspid
    and pulmonary leaflets.  There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Flow velocity could not be optimally
    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
4.  There is no evident pericardial effusion.


 
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.  History from family sounds much more like seizure.  Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.  Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.  Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.
Continue MI rule-out
Repeat echo
Continue telemetry
EEG
F/u TSH
F/U UA / Ucx
F/U guiac
F/U neuro recs

2) Hx of clot- continue coumadin

3) DM     continue outpatient regimen, but hold for procedures

4) HTN     continue outpatient regimen, but hold for low BP

5) Hypothyroid     continue synthroid

6) Hx TIA     continue plavix

Dear Dr. Mcfarland:


I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.


As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture. Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies. She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.


Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively. She has had a negative cardiac stress test.


PMH as above


Meds: synthroid, labetalol, norvasc, glipizide, coumadin, erythropoetin, pravastatin, ultram, albuterol, pentasa


Allergies: PCN, cephalosporins, vancomysin, shellfish


SH: no tobacco ever. She is a professional tool maker. She has a dog
FH: asthma, CAD, DM, HTN


ROS: as per HPI, otherwise negative in detail


EXAM:
HR 88, BP 135/60, 98% RA, Wt 146lb
OP clear
Lungs CTAB
Heart RRR
Abdomen soft NTND

PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal. There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator. The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit. Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated. Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.








IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial. It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed. In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab. Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture. There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either. I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her. I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma. We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.


Seen and d/w Dr. Weller
