Re: Nancy Xayarath

ANC Unit #:  111-64-17



Dear Dr. Townsend:



	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot.



	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.  She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.  She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot. She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.  Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in. Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.  



	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.  She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.  Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.  She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.

	

	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.  She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.  She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely. She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  The skin is of normal turgor. She has no active plantar ulcers on

either foot. At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.  



	No new x-rays were obtained today.



	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.



	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.  It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.  I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.  I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.  We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer. She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you kindly for this referral.



Best personal regards,

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.



She had been losing weight and feeling fatigued. She has been at her current weight for several weeks and feels that she has stabilized. Appetite has been good. 



Home Blood Tests:  No records. She reports that she drops from the 200's to the normal range in the morning. Her bedtime test is about 3-4 hours after summer.  

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Xiques in the Spring. May need laser for p-cataract film. Retinas stable.

Nephropathy:	Cr 1.0 in September. Saw Dr. Caldwell re her Charcot foot. He put her in a boot and wheelchair for 3 weeks and it resolved well. 

Cardiac:	Gets little tingling sensations in her anterior chest, occurring at any times. Not specifically at times of physical exercise. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: Prograf reduced.



Review of Systems: 

GI: Feels that her abdomen is uncomfortable much of the time. Not precipitated or relieved by food. Upper and lower abdominal. No change in volume or nature of ileostomy output. She has dysphagia for liquids, sometimes with regurgitation. 

Had Pap and mammogram through ANC gynecologist.

She saw Dr. Wilhelm for sinus problems. He got an MRI. It showed a meningioma of the jugular foramen. Dr. Wilhelm's note indicated that she would see Dr. New for that and indeed she has seen Dr. New, although she says it is for a tumor on the vocal cord. 

He also wanted her to see Dr. Carter about a vocal cord paralysis, and that visit is upcoming. 





Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   118/70		P:   72, regular

Wt:   118.5 without shoes, down 8.5

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Dyskinetic prominent apical impulse. Normal S1; single S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. Small epigastric hernia with mild tenderness in that area. Ileostomy. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.       DP 2+,=.  PT absent. Prominent mound of tissue in the plantar aspect of L foot, from Charcot changes, but with very normal skin covering.  Good foot care.



Impressions and Plan:	

Many active issues.

Hard to assess control without data. Must bring them to visits.

For now, reduce the Lantus to 8 U since she drops overnight by history.

Will need to talk with Dr. Wilhelm and Dr. New about their respective perspectives and figure out who is addressing the meningioma and hydrocephalus. May need to see a neurologist. 

Refer to Dr. Sanders for evaluation of her gastrointestinal discomfort and dysphagia for liquids. I suspect a motility disorder.

She needs follow-up with Dr. Arndt. 

1 hour; most counseling and coordination of care.

A1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, CBC, anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, TSH.



Appointments:	1 month

Patient initially noted an abrasion and some ecchymosis around the knee joint and been weight bearing without difficultly.  Patient reports frequent falls at home due to her neuropathy but is ambulatory without assist.  On December 19th, she noted some erythema around the knee joint and the lateral aspect of her shin and started developing pain and swelling that slightly limited her range of motion.  She also noted some knee stiffness.  Denies any drainage from injury site.  Patient did speak to the NP at her PCPs office and was advised to be evaluated in the ED.


ED course:  On arrival, the patient&#8217;s vitals were: 99.2 80 109/66 97%/RA.  Per report, a tap of the left knee was attempted but no fluid could be aspirated.  Blood cultures yielded GPC in pairs in &#189; bottles.  Patient was started on vancomycin and developed an itchy rash at the infusion site (right arm).

Blood cultures are growing GPC in pairs and patient has history of MR-CNS and patient had rash with vancomycin so will keep on linezolid for now.  Patient does have history of MR and ?endocarditis but will hold off on echo given patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  If surveillance blood cultures continue to be positive, will consider adding gentamycin and checking echo.

Cellulitis:  Linezolid x 14 days (12/21-1/03); f/u blood cultures; check surveillance blood cultures; PICC c/s after blood cx negative x48 hours.  f/u ID recs.  PT/OT consult.
Renal/Lytes: continue tacrolimus and check daily levels per transplant.  f/u transplant recommendations.  slightly high K this am, likely due to missed insulin.  Will monitor for now.
CV: complete rule out; keep on telemetry for now given hyperkalemia and EKG changes; continue home regiment
GI: continue omeprazole, will make outpatient GI aware
Diabetes: continue outpatient regiment of lantus + insulin SS with meals.  Will check blood sugars AC + 10 pm + 2 am per endocrine
Psych: will hold celexa while patient on linezolid given risk of serotonin syndrome
F/E/N: diabetic diet
Ppx: warfarin, omperazole
