QUINLEY,CORA   759-87-55-2                         VISIT DATE: 12/15/76

This patient was seen by me in the emergency department on  

December 15, 2076, with the resident.  Resident's note reviewed.  

Patient interviewed and examined by me.  See resident's note for 

further details.  Past medical history, social history, and family 

history all reviewed and confirmed with the resident's note. 

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a pleasant 

70-year-old female who comes in with substernal chest pressure, a 

tightness involving her upper back also, two distinct discomforts.  

There are no exertional symptoms, no nausea, no vomiting, no 

diarrhea, no abdominal pain, and no palpitations.  The patient does 

report some mild shortness of breath.  The chest pressure is not 

acute in onset.  There is no exacerbation with activity.  She had a 

negative exercise tolerance test four years ago.  Since being here, 

she has received some improvement in her symptoms after 

nitroglycerin.  She has no known coronary disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation and insulin-dependent 

diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is an active smoker 

and lives alone.  No family history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is hemodynamically stable, nontoxic, 

well appearing, resting comfortably.  NECK:  No jugulovenous 

distention.  LUNGS:  Clear.  HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  

ABDOMEN:  Soft.  NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  White count is 7.8, hematocrit 41.  Normal 

electrolyte panel.  Troponin I is 0.3 which is elevated.  CK is 160 

which is normal.  The EKG shows some flattening T wave laterally 

which is old.  A chest x-ray shows no effusion, infiltrate, or 

pneumothorax.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient has a positive troponin 

here and will be admitted.  She will be heparinized __________ 

started.  See resident's note for details.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

                          OFFICE NOTE

 

Cora Quinley

MR# 759-87-55-2

March 3, 2077

 

As the responsible teaching attending, I can confirm both the

history and physical examination of Dr. Uriel Zapien. Briefly, the

patient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk

factors. She was admitted to the hospital in January after a

prolonged episode of palpitations. The patient had a tiny

Troponin  elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage

her conservatively. The patient continues to have these episodes

of palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any

exercise.

 

Her current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,

statin and an ACE Inhibitor. 

 

On physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal

upstrokes and no bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her

heart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,

without S3 and S4.

 

Her electrocardiogram is normal.

 

Assessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the

patient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular

tachycardia. She will be seen back here in several months.

FOLLOW-UP VISIT: CAD, DM, HTN



HPI:  The pt is a 71 yo female here for follow-up visit for DM monitoring, lipid management, htn.  She was hospitalized for acute MI last December and is being followed by cardiology.  Since her last follow-up the patient has had no episodes of exertional or rest chest pain, no DOE or SOB.  She was visiting her relatives in Oregon this month and did have one episode of SVT in setting of viral URI.  Experienced sudden onset of palpitations with discomfort, lasted 30 minutes without chest pain, lightheadedness or diaphoresis and then resolved spontaneously.  She has had no further episodes.  She has been compliant with her medications over the last few months and has not experienced any side effects; however, when asked directly, has had 2 or 3 episodes of lightheadedness in morning with abrupt position changes, nothing long-lasting and no near syncope.

     Pt reports blood sugars by finger stick at home of 100-140s generally.  Has had good control by her accounts over last few months.  Was unaware of results of May blood draw with increase in HA1C of 8.0.



Medical problems:

SVT  

LGI BLEEDING  

SMOKING  

H. PYLORI  

NIDDM  

Coronary artery disease  

Myocardial infarction  



Current medications:

MICRONASE 5 MG     PO QD  

RANITIDINE HCL   150MG  1 Tablet(s) PO BID  Take as directed 

ATENOLOL   25MG  3 Tablet(s) PO QD One 25 and one 50 mg tab daily 90 day(s)

ZOCOR (SIMVASTATIN)   20MG  1 Tablet(s) PO QHS  Take as directed  90 day(s)

ZESTRIL (LISINOPRIL)   20MG  1 Tablet(s) PO QD  Take as directed  90 day(s)

AMITRIPTYLINE HCL   25MG  1 Tablet(s) PO QHS 

ECASA (ASPIRIN ENTERIC COATED)   325MG  1 Tablet(s) PO QD 



PE:  bp 130/72 p 72  wt 213 (up from 203)

chest: CTA B

cor: RRR nl s1 s2, no murmurs

abd: soft NT ND with normal BS

ext: normal pulses, no edema



Labs:  last hemoglobin A1C in 5/77 of 8.0, gluc 192, LDL 115, TG 71, HDL 36



A/P:  71 yo female with DM, HTN, and heart disease with slightly worsening glycemic and lipid control when tested 2 months ago, perhaps related to modest weight gain of 10 lbs.

     1. DM - pt with rising A1C despite good FS at home.  Given pt feels control has improved since last visit, will stall on changing micronase until next visit at one month.  Pt to have repeat a1c at that point, and if still high, will double micronase.  Good bp control on zestril.  Had microalb this year.  Still awaiting visit to ophthal - gave pt another referral.

     2. CAD - pt with LDL of 115 when previously well controlled on this dose of zocor.  After negotiation with patient, have agreed to wait to raise dose until next visit as well.  Would benefit from 30 mg tab.  Otherwise TG look good.  Pt with episode of SVT in setting of viral illness.  BP and pulse will tolerate small increment in b-blocker.  Given known CAD without intervention, impt to control SVTs.  Increase atenolol to 100 mg QD, keep zestril at current dose.

     3. HM - pt refuses mammogram.  She continues to be suspicious that screening tests are experimental and given her age "wouldn't change anything."  Discussed baseline bone density test, and she has agreed to consider this.  Refused colonscopy at this point.

Dear Dr. Feldman:

We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
today in the Cardiology clinic.  As you know, she is a
very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  She
last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
Oregon.  Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
been doing quite well.  She states that she has episodes of
palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
minutes.  She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope. 
She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.  Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.  She
states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
Cessation Program.

Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
Protonix, and Allegra.

On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress. 
Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
beats per minute.  Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
edema.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits. 
JVP is 8 cm of water.  Chest is clear to auscultation and
percussion bilaterally.  PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.  Abdomen
is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.  Pulse examination is
normal.

Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.

ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.  There is a nonspecific Q-wave
abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
compared to prior.

In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.  Her palpitations and
likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
quite acceptable for her.  Therefore, she wishes no consideration
of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.  She
has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.  Regarding
her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
diabetes.  However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
LDL.  Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
to 40 mg q.h.s.

I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months. 
Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
cardiovascular issues.  Thank you very much for referring this
very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.  

Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.
