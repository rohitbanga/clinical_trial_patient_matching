PROBLEMS:
1.   Multinodular goiter.
2.   Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.   Diabetic retinopathy.
4.   History of smoking.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Ecotrin, 1 q.d., Synthroid, 0.5 mg. q.d.  Patient has not 
been taking in 3 months after running out of prescription.  Micronaise 5 
mg. q.d.  Premarin 0.625 mg. q.d.
 
HPI:  Mrs. Stephenson returns for her follow-up visit for her diabetes and 
multinodular goiter.  She says that she has no new complaints since the 
last visit.  She denies any episodes of pyuria, dyspnea, weight loss or 
weight gain.  She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain and ankle 
edema.  She has seen her ophthalmologist several months ago and has 
another visit today.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 125/90.  There are no new changes on 
exam.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  Patient's hemoglobin A1c in 2/74 
     was 10.8.  Will recheck hemoglobin on this visit as well as the UA 
          ketones and hemoglobin once she remains elevated on the 
     present dose of Micronase will consider increasing.
 
2.   Multinodular goiter.  Patient's right hemithyroid has unchanged on 
     exam.  She has been off of her Synthroid for 3 months.  We will 
     refill her prescription and reassess her goiter after 6 months of 
     treatment.
 
3.   Diabetic retinopathy.  Ophthalmology follow-up today.
 
4.   Smoking history.  Patient quit smoking in 2/74 after using a 
     Habitrol patch and has not smoked since.
 
5.   Hypercholesteremia.  Patient had an elevated cholesterol of 319 and 
     triglycerides of 751.  Although these were not fasting levels.  It 
     is suspected the patient will need to have medications to control 
     her hypoglycemia.  Will set her up with the Nutrition department 
     for now for a modified diet.
                                              7-20-74
 
 
 
6.   Elevated blood pressure.  Blood pressure is borderline at this 
     point.  Will recheck and have the patient adhere to her no-added 
     salt diet.
 
Patient will follow up in 10/74.  Will call the patient if her Micronase 
dose needs to be increased.  She will have an appointment with the 
nutritionist in order to start a no-added salt and low cholesterol diet.

HPI:  Ms. Stephenson is a 57-year old woman who has a history of multinodular 
goiter status post a hemithyroidectomy 7 years ago, and 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years complicated 
by diabetic retinopathy.  She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin 
replacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with 
Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse 
practitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively 
compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease 
process appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a 
day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes 
intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood 
sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the 
non-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, 
excessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid 
medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out 
of the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and 
has not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, 
palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about 
potentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific 
complaints.  She has a good energy level.
 
Social History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Habits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has 
been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning 
on stopping this.
 
Physical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam 
reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe 
without specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her 
oropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is 
obese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her 
skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral 
edema.
 
Assessment/Plan:
 
1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a 
     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about 
     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine 
     dipsticks.  
 
2)   History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her

     need for Synthroid replacement.
 
3)   Routine health screening.  She does not need a pap smear.  She has 
     had a TAH; however, I will perform a mammogram on her today.  She 
     will come back and see me in one month to get the results of these 
     tests, and we will make treatment decisions at that time.

13 Willow St                             Stephenson, Brenda
Frackville, MD  73116                             92819461

Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
was positive.  She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.  She had 1mm 
and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
disease.  She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
vigorously, which is rapidly walking.  She vehemently denies that she 
has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
 
We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
 
PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.  She 
refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
for taking it.  She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
on atenolol.  
 
Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.  
 
We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.  I will continue to work 
with her strenuously on risk factor modification.  Her other risk 
factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.  Her 
diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
 
She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
hospital.

EDVISIT^92819461^STEPHENSON, BREDNA^07/15/86^WALLACE, VELMA

I saw this patient on 07/15/2086 in conjunction with Dr. Echols. 

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 68-year-old female with leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known coronary

artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes, status

post left fem-pop bypass and transmetatarsal amputation of her

left foot at the Siouxland on 05/02/2086.  This was complicated by

acute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and

labile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for

approximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh

erythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. 

She has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty

ambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild

stomach upset.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,

diabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and

D1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,

hydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,

Synthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no

acute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: 

Temperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood

pressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For

full physical exam findings, please see the resident's written

note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic

exams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam

reveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. 

Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. 

Musculoskeletal exam:  The fem-pop incision on the left leg is

concerning for purulent drainage along the incision site,

especially along the upper aspect of the upper thigh.  There is

approximately an area of 8 x 5 cm of erythema, induration, and

tenderness surrounding the area draining purulent material.  The

patient also has a transmetatarsal amputation.  The wound there

is clean, dry, and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count of 10.9, BUN and creatinine ratio of 30:1.4 respectively.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Surgery was consulted regarding

this likely wound infection.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and

Flagyl were their request for antibiotics.  These were

administered in the Emergency Department, and the patient will be

admitted for likely operative debridement of this wound

infection.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Postsurgical infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetes.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Peripheral vascular disease.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted.
