PRESENT SINCE MID 2060'S. FOLLOWED BY DR. THACKER AT DARDANELLE HOSPITAL. 

	ETT 5/12/82 TO 98% PRMHR SHOWED ST CHANGES WHICH WERE SUGGESTIVE BUT NOT DIAGNOSTIC AND THERE WAS BASELINE LVH WITH STRAIN BUT THALLIUM WAS NEG. THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PVC'S AND COUPLETS AND TWO 3 BEAT RUNS OF VT.     HAD BEEN ACCEPTABLE ALBEIT ON AN ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HAD EVOLVED. SUBOPTIMAL WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT GAIN 5/23/86. WILL RECHECK 6-8 WEEKS AFTER 8-10 LB WEIGHT LOSS. ETT THAL SCHEDULED, GIVEN ABNL ECG, RISK FACTORS, AND HIS CONTINUING DESIRE TO EXERCISE. 

	5/86 EXCELLENT EXERCISE CAPACITY TO 9 METS, ECG NONDIAGNOSTIC DUE TO BASELINE ABNORMALITIES BUT THALLIUM NL.     

	150/74 7/86 AND WILL ACCEPT THIS FOR NOW BUT STILL NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT. 

	140/78 9/86 WO WEIGHT LOSS. REDISCUSSED IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SIMPLIFY HIS REGIMEN CONSIDERABLY. HE REMAINS ON VERY ELABORATE REGIMEN THAT HE HAD BEEN ON FOR YEARS BY DR. TITUS.   (8/8/87)
[28-Aug-2088]
	REASONABLE CONTROL ON REGIMEN, BUT STILL NEEDS WEIGHT LOSS.  78-9 really not adequate control with his mild diabetes; increased Cardura to 8 mg without help.  Change Procardia XL to Norvasc with increase from 15 to 20 mg.  BP control acceptable. 

	7/91 still a bit suboptima and Lisinopril increased from 40mg to 60mg per day.  Continue to emphasize weight loss.  

hyperglycemia

FBS 154 AND HBA1C 6.44 = 129 ON 4/87, DONE BY HPLC METHODS SINCE THERE HAD BEEN A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN BLOOD SUGARS AND HBA1C LEVELS, AND THIS WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH RESULT BY AFFINITY. DISCUSSED DIETARY CHANGE AT LENGTH. 8/87 VISIT.  (8/8/87)  A1C 6.10 = 117.  BLOOD SUGARS BECAME HIGHER, HE DID EXCEPT NUTRITION REFERRAL, BEGUN ON METFORMIN 500 BID WITH GI SXS WHEN 3RD DOSE ADDED.  5/88 A1C 7.04 = 149.  AT THAT POINT HAD LOST 14 POUNDS.  [28-Aug-2088]

LAST EPISODE WAS ABT A YR AGO. NO HO UROLITHIASIS. DISCUSSED POSSIBLE ROLE OF FUROSEMIDE, AND SINCE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLR TO ME WHY HE NEEDS TO BE ON A HIGH DOSE OF FUROSEMIDE IT MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE ADJUSTED. HOWEVER, NO FURTHER EPISODES.  UNTIL POSTOP 3/86 ATTACK.  HAVE REDUCED FUROSEMIDE.  SPRING 2088 HAVING SOME MILD SXS THAT COULD BE PODAGRA AND SOME ANKLE SXS, THOUGH W/O OVERT INFLAMMATION.  WONDER WHETHER LEFT OLECRANON  COULD BE TOPHUS.  HIS RIGHT FOURTH TOE ALSO HAS A LONGSTANDING DEFORMITY WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL FOR TOPHUS BUT COULD BE.  URIC ACID 7.8 1/88. URIC ACID DONE TODAY.

Chief Complaint	

Admission note- Internal Medicine

Kenneth Weeks- 1205466





History of Present Illness	

Mr. Weeks is a 78 yr. old male who was admitted for further cardiac testing.



His PMH includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.  He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.  He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.  He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some "indigestion" the past few days.  It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).  This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.  



An ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.  His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.  



A Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.  His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.  The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.  LV function preserved.



He was admitted electively today for further evaluation. He arrives to Internal Medicine chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.

Plan:



1. Cardiac:  Currently pain free and hemodynamically stable

         -- Admit to Internal Medicine/telemetry

         -- NPO after MN for cardiac cath in the am

         -- Will begin ECASA

         -- Continue Atenolol- pt. recently changed from Cardiazem to Atenolol given ETT results.  HR well controlled at present.

         -- Continue Norvasc and Avapro- SBP currently well controlled. 

         -- Pt euvolemic on exam- will continue Lasix - holding tomorrow pre-cath. Follow strict I/O's and daily weights- will adjust Lasix dose as needed depending on fluid status and renal function. 

         -- Pt in AF- last Coumadin dose on Friday- will begin Heparin pre cath.  Will need to resume coumadin once all interventions completed.



2. Renal: Pre cath creatinine 2.1.  Pt had renal angiogram in 4/95 which showed patent renal arteries.

         -- Will give Mucomyst and NaHCO3 protocol pre cath.    

         -- Monitor urine output.  

         -- Follow renal function closely post dye load

         -- Will hold ARB and diuretic pre- cath- will reassess post cath.



3. DM: Long hx of DM- per pt. well controlled on present regimine

Will continue NPH and Glipizide- holding in am of cath.  Will check fingersticks QID and cover with RISS.  Diabetic diet. Pt. also reports poor dietary compliance- will obtain nutrition consult.



4. Thrombocytopenia: Pt with long history of low platelets- per pt. he has never had this worked up.  Will follow closely. ? need for hematology consult at some point- will discuss with Dr. Felder.  Watch CBC closely while on Heparin.

Dear Thomas:



  Thank you very much for referring Mr.  Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.  As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.  The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.  After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.  It has been progressive over the last several months.  He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.  He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.  He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.



Past medical history:

   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.  

Hypertension.  

Hypercholesterolemia.  

Hyperhomocysteinemia.  

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  

Gout.  

Renal insufficiency.  

Mild thrombocytopenia.



Current Medications:

  atenolol 25 mg BID

 Coumadin; Dir: as directed

 Ecotrin 325 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 Lasix 120 mg qd

 folate 1 mg qd

 allopurinol 100 mg qd

 Ativan

 Proscar

 free text medications; Dir: Insulin

 Protonix



Allergies:

No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.



Family history:

   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.  There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.



Social history:

   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.



Review of systems:

   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.  He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.  He denies hematochezia.  He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.  He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   55 and regular

-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  He does have low dullness in both bases

-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.  He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis



Procedures:

Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.  His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 158/80.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.  The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.



EKG:

    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.



Selected recent labs:

 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.
