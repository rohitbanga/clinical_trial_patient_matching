Re: Larry Lockwood

MPC# 590-33-20-3

 

 

This is a 56 year old morbidly obese male who was discharged recently from 

the 

Marshalltown Pond Clinic who is here for follow up of his newly diagnosed 

diabetes mellitus. He was seen in the emergency room on 10/21 with the 

complaint of urinary frequency, hesitancy, and generally not feeling well. 

Prior to that, he had been treated with antibiotics by his primary care 

physician for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and then ampicillin but 

he did not get better. He went to the emergency room and was admitted to the 

hospital because his blood sugar was in the 400s and he was diagnosed with 

diabetes at that time. He was discharged on 10/22/78 on insulin NPH 30 units 

in 

the morning and 15 units in the PM and was advised to follow up in the 

outpatient clinic today. Since discharge, his blood sugars have been in the 

200s. This afternoon, it is 242 2 hours after his last meal.

 

Past Medical History: He has a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. He 

sees a urologist and they are discussing a new procedure for the same. He 

cannot have ______ because of his morbid obesity, he cannot be positioned on 

the table for the same. He also gives a history of sleep apnea. No 

hypertension. He does have a history of gastric reflux and obesity.

 

Past Surgical History: He has had bilateral hip surgery for slipped ______ as 

an adolescent.

 

Review of Systems: No chest pain. Positive review of systems for UTI symptoms 

with increased frequency and hesitancy. Other review of systems-he has 

arthritis generalized with more pain in the hip. Also has acid reflux.

 

Family History: Family history of obesity and hypertension but no diabetes or 

coronary artery disease.

 

Social History: He is a smoker but is trying to quit. He smokes less than one 

pack a day. He is a manager and is on disability. He has 2 children and is 

separated.

 

Physical Examination: He is morbidly obese and weighs about 405 pounds. Blood 

pressure 110/88. Pulse 84. Skin exam-there is evidence of acanthosis 

nigricans. He has gynecomastia. Head and neck exam-atraumatic, normocephalic. 

Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. 

Cardiovascular system exam-S1, S2 heard. No S3, S4. Respiratory system-clear 

to auscultation and percussion. No added sounds. Abdomen-obese, very 

difficult 

to examine for masses or hepatosplenomegaly. On limited exam, there are no 

masses palpable. CNS-cranial nerves II-XII intact. Examination of feet with 

monofilament is negative as he is not able to feel the monofilament in both 

feet. This impairment is greater on the right foot than left.

 

Labs done so far:  hemoglobin A1c of 14, glucose on 10/21 422, creatinine 1.7, 

BUN 22, sodium 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 97, liver function tests with ALT 

10, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 126, bilirubin 0.4, total protein 8.1, 

albumin 3.6, globulin 4.5, calcium 9.5, hemoglobin 15.

 

Assessment and Plan: 1. New onset diabetes mellitus. The patient is morbidly 

obese, has features of insulin resistance. His blood sugars today are better 

since admission. He is on insulin twice a day. He checks his blood sugars 3 

times a day and since discharge, they have been around 240 to 300. The 

patient 

is not a good candidate for metformin with his last creatinine of 1.7. He may 

be a candidate for Avandia. At the present time, his alkaline phosphatase is 

mildly elevated but his ALT and AST are normal. He has difficulty coming to 

the clinic and would prefer to have his visiting nurse and nutritionist 

communicate with the clinic physicians to adjust the dose of his insulin and 

also have his blood tests done locally rather than here in the clinic. We 

will 

increase his NPH to 40 units in the morning and 26 units in the PM. We will 

work with the visiting nurse and nutritionist to adjust the insulin dose and 

also order lab tests. We will repeat his hemoglobin A1c in a month and also 

repeat his creatinine and liver function tests at that time to see if he may 

be a candidate for Avandia. I advised the patient to return to the clinic in 

6 

months and also for him to send the blood sugar results every week until his 

blood sugars are under better control.

History of Present Illness

POD # 3 

Procedure  femoral-femoral bypass graft   

Surgeon    U. Needham



Narrative History

This gentleman has type 2 DM diagnosed in  2078.  At that time he was seen at the ED with urinary frequency and was not feeling well. He was admitted to the hospital for BG's of 400's.  He was discharged on NPH insulin 30 units q am and 15 units q pm.  He has followed up with Dr. Xan Dunn from our Diabetes department. 

His latest home DM regimen consists of NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.

His home BG's are usually 130 or less.

He has hypoglycemia unawareness.

He has PVD s/p fem-fem bypass graft 6/30/80, ulcer on R big toe, (+)peripheral neuropathy.

Assessment

Type 2 DM complicated by PVD and neuropathy.  He was not eating well 7/01-7/02 but says his appetite has now recovered.



Recommendation

1.  Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.

2.  Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).  Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.

3.  Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.  This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.

4.  He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.





Thank you.

Norma Umali, M.D.

Dear Dr. Umali:

Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.  Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.  He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.

Review of systems is negative except as above.  Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.

Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.

Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.

Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.  BP 169/83 and pulse 58.  Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  No edema, warm.

Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.  Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.  Skeletal films are pending.

Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..  He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.  I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.  I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.  However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.

In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.  He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.  Thank you for referring this patient.

Sincerely,
