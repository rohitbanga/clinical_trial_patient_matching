RE:  Shilpa Pickett
     MR #129-53-47-3
 
Dear Philip:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
Clinic today.  Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain. 
She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
position.  As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.  
 
Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.  Of note, she was
taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.  Labetalol 200
mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
 
On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12. 
There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are free
of bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiac
exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.  Abdomen
is soft and nontender.  The extremities are free of edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
 
In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
increase in weight.  We will be rechecking her lipid profile today. 
She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.  She
notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression. 
She has had no change in her hair or skin.  For the

moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.  
 
It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
Pickett' care.  Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
can be of help with.
 
Sincerely,

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished female with a 
Glasgow Coma Scale of 15.  HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck 
supple without spinal tenderness.  Heart regular rate and rhythm, 
positive 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Chest is clear.  Abdomen is 
soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities without 
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neuro alert and oriented times three, 
good motor strength throughout, sensory intact, no focality.

EASLEY BAPTIST HOSPITAL                         Pickett, Silpa 
                                              12953473
                                              03-20-63 
 
 
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
numerous complaints.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
since her upper respiratory tract infection.  She had the flu in January 
and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
weeks ago.  She states that this has severely debilitated her.  She is 
complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and 
occasional dull headache.  However, her main concern is her stomach and 
her back.  Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.  This is different than her 
reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
Prilosec-Propulsid combination.  She is describing some anorexia, although 
she has not lost any weight.  She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
movements.  She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.  She wonders 
whether this could be in gallbladder.  In addition, she is continuing to 
have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
distribution.  She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
back.  Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.  
 
She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.  Her sugars 
have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.  Her blood 
pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.  She is saturating well.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.  
There was no JVD.  Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ? S3 
with no significant murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.  
Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.  
Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.  
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
and cerebrovascular disease.  She came in today for discussion of her 
ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
 
With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
codeine, which has helped in the past.  I gave her a prescription.  I 
warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.  She should 
contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
steroid injection.
 
With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
disease.  Unclear contribution from her reflux.  Dr. Mario Robison 
recommended elective cholecystectomy.  Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to

consider her for the surgery.  I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
make an informed decision about the surgery.  
 
She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.  She would probably do better 
with lower blood pressure.  We could consider increasing her Imdur.  
 
I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

EDVISIT^12953473^PICKETT, SHILPA^06/27/69^RICO, WILLARD

The patient was seen with Dr. Mueller.  I confirmed her history and

physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient.  Please

see her note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a

several-week history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, which

has worsened over the past 3 days, per the patient and her son. 

These episodes are "gassy feeling" in the epigastrium associated

with nausea and vomiting and lightheadedness.  No chest pain, no

shortness of breath.  Of note, the patient has a history of

coronary artery disease with atypical symptoms.  She has also had

a history of pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert, in no distress at

this time.  Afebrile with a pulse of 62, blood pressure 140/60,

and O2 sat 100% on room air.  Neck is supple with no signs of

meningismus.  Head is atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Lungs

are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart has regular rate

and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to

palpation.  No guarding or rebound on my exam.  Extremities are

warm and well perfused.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's IV access was

established.  Labs were drawn revealing white count of 8,

hematocrit of 39.  BUN and creatinine of 36 and 1.5, which is

normal for the patient.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is slightly

elevated at 67.  Troponin less than assay.  Urinalysis 25-30

white cells.  The patient's EKG was left bundle-branch block,

which is unchanged.  KUB shows no air fluid levels.  This patient

has a possible mild pancreatitis as well as a mild urinary tract

infection.  In addition, she has multiple cardiac risk factors

and an EKG, which will not allow for conventional cardiac stress

testing.

She will be admitted the hospital for enzymatic rule out MI with

a possible necessity to have a stress MIBI as well as to give IV

antibiotics for urinary tract infection and hydration and serial

exams for her probable pancreatitis.  The patient was admitted to

the floor in stable condition.
