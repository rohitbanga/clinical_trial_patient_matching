EDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEC^07/25/60^YERGER, DESEAN

The patient was seen with Dr. Godfrey.  I confirmed her history

and physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient. 

Please see the note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with

a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2

weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with

stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.  The

patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this

ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest

discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous

episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with

activity.  He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented

for further evaluation and treatment.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and

Altace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,

chest pain free.  Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,

and O2 saturation 98% on room air.  His lungs are clear to

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft

and nontender.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No

elevated JVP.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right

bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic

changes.  IV access was established.  Labs were sent revealing

essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.  Initial troponin was

less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was

normal.  The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival. 

Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional

beta-blockade was given to the patient.  However, based on his

story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given

Lovenox in the emergency room.  I spoke to the Cardiology B

attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his

service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future. 

With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a

diagnosis of unstable angina.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.

Dear Vernon,

I write to summarize for your records the recent IMC course of your patient, Dr. Alec Gipson, who was admitted to our cardiology service on 07/25/2060 with progressive angina and a small, non-ST elevation MI.  His cardiac troponin rose to 0.13.  There were no demonstrable ECG changes, though we queried the possibility of a left circumflex event.  He had been previously scheduled for semi-urgent catheterization and angiography on 07/26/2060.

His condition stabilized with institution of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy.  He was taken to the catheterization laboratory by Dr. Otero on 07/26/2060.  Angiography demonstrated a high-grade lesion in the proximal portion of a large first diagonal branch, as well as a significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch.  The diagonal lesion was managed with angioplasty and deployment of a drug-eluting stent.  A drug-eluting stent could not be delivered to the obtuse marginal lesion; a bare-metal stent was positioned without difficulty.  He did have smoldering chest discomfort of an anginal nature following the procedure.  The cardiac troponin elevated further to a peak value of 0.86 as of 07/27/2060 (08:54).  He also had a mild, vagal reaction characterized by flushing and transient bradycardia.

He felt much improved the following day.  A repeat cardiac troponin returned at a lower level of 0.75.  An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of an AAA.  After consultation with you, we felt that he could return home, under the care of his wife.

He was discharged on the afternoon of 07/27/2060.  His medications included Ecotrin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d., niacin 500 mg b.i.d., ramipril 2.5 mg daily, and nitroglycerin if needed.

Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information.

Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEXANDER^01/31/61^VELASQUEZ, WALTER

This patient was seen by myself and Dr. Hardin on 01/31/2061.  I

confirm I interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation, and discussed the plan of care with the

patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old gentleman who

has a history of CAD status post stent in 2060, who developed

acute chest discomfort, pressure like, diaphoresis, and weakness,

while he was working as a chiropractor.  He says although this

was quite significant, it was not like his prior MI discomfort. 

He denies any radiation to his back or his arm.  He denies any

jaw pain.  He denies any fever, chills, or sweats.  He denies any

vomiting.  He denies any headache or neck pain.  He denies any

bowel or bladder changes and no lower extremity edema.  He is

taking his medicines.  He also took an aspirin, did get some

nitroglycerin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension,

hypercholesterolemia, and CAD.

MEDICATIONS:  Cozaar, aspirin, Altace, metformin, and Toprol.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, not a drinker or drug user.

 He lives with his family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the HPI, otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is in no acute distress at rest.  He

says his chest pain is essentially gone on oxygen.  Vital signs

are as noted.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Normocephalic

and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light. 

Extraocular motions are intact.  Oropharynx is unremarkable. 

Neck is supple.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Chest is

clear to auscultation.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  His

abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly. 

There are no masses.  His skin is warm and dry.  There is no

lower extremity edema.  He has equal pulses.  His neuro exam is

alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  His cranial

nerves are intact.  He is grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  He has a white count of 8, hematocrit of 46,

and platelet count of 200,000.  His SMA-7 is unremarkable.  CK-MB

and troponin are flat and INR is 1.  His EKG shows less than 1 mm

ST depressions in V2, without any reciprocal or other changes.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient with a history of CAD with concerning

symptoms.  He did have a fight earlier in the day, although was

not under significant stress at the time of this event.  Given

his prior CAD history, the patient was given Lopressor.  Decision

was made to admit him for rule out acute coronary syndrome.  The

patient was admitted in stable condition.  The patient had

already got an aspirin and the patient remained in stable

condition until he was admitted.

DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out acute coronary syndrome.

Ulysses Peralta, M.D.
82 March Street
Coalinga, FL  84635


Dear Dr. Peralta:


I saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis.  He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.  His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.  He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days.  He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days.  He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.  He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.  He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.  Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.


We performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.  He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.  He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.  The discomfort resolved into recovery.  He had no ST segment changes.  His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.  There was normal RV size as well.  There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.  These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.


As you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.


His current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.


On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.


His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.


I think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.  I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.  I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.  His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.  I think we can maintain our current approach.  I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.


If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.


Kindest regards.


Sincerely yours,
