                                              9-5-67
 
 
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Vance is a 45 year old woman with diabetes, 
porphyria and coronary artery disease, who came in today for annual visit.  
 
HPI:  
1.   Pain in right hand.  The patient has a Dupuytren's contraction in the 
     right hand.  She did have one in the left hand for which she had 
     surgery in June, 2064.  The surgery was performed by Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg.  At that time, she also had an ulnar nerve decompression.  
     She had trigger fingers in the left index and ring finger as well, 
     which were repaired.  She is a Transport Operations Supervisor that uses her hands 
     extensively and is very concerned about the pain in her right hand.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  She only rarely checks her blood sugars.  They 
     tend to run about 160.  She has had diabetes for 28 years.  She takes 
     NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m. and CGI 10 units sub q q.a.m.  She 
     is not on an evening dose.  Her last ophthalmology visit was in 6/66.  
     She denies any problems with peripheral neuropathy.  
3.   Coronary artery disease.  She is status post single vessel CABG in 
     9/61 for isolated lesion.  Since then she has had no angina.  She has 
     been on no medications for coronary artery disease since 2063.  
4.   Left breast lesion.  She was found to have a breast mass in 12/66 and 
     underwent wire localization and biopsy.  At that  time, she had micro 
     calcifications on her mammogram at that time.  The past report 
     revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia only.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m., CGI 10 units sub 
q q.a.m., Tylenol p.r.n., aspirin 85 mg PO q.d.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure 114/50.  Weight 111.5 lbs.  General 
appearance: healthy appearing middle aged woman in no acute distress.  
HEENT: no retinopathy was noted on my exam.  Neck: no thyromegaly.  Chest 
is clear to P&A.  She has sternotomy scars present.  Cardiac: normal S1, 
S2.  Breasts: right breast is normal, left breast reveals surgical 
incisional scars at 12:00 and 3:00 O'clock.  She does have a firm mass 
below the incisional scar at 3:00 P.M.  Abdomen: midline scar in the lower 
abdomen is evident from her C section.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  
Extremities: no edema.  Pelvic exam: external genitalia are normal.  
Vagina, cervix, fundus, adnexae all normal.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1.   Painful right hand.  The patient was referred back to Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg for evaluation for surgery.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  I asked the patient to keep track of her blood 
     sugars for then next month and to return to see me.  I also checked a 
     BUN and creatinine as well as a urine micro albumen.  We checked her 
     annual cholesterol.  Her previous cholesterol was done 5/66 and was 
     203.  She was referred to Dr. Nava for a good retinal exam.

                                              9-5-67
 
 
 
3.   Status post CABG.  I started her on atenolol 25 mg PO q.d. given that 
     she does have coronary artery disease, and there is a question as to 
     whether or not she had an MI in 2061, which she will return in one 
     month for blood pressure check and also to review her blood sugars.

RE:  Jennifer Vance

     MR #542-66-00-3

 

Dear Vester:

 

Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac

evaluation.  As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it

briefly for our records.  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with

a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and

significant coronary artery disease.  In 2061, after a four to five

day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to

the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography

revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. 

She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with

inadequate results.  She therefore was taken electively for

coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left

internal mammary artery to her LAD.  She subsequently continued to

have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization

in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%

stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%

stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The catheterization

report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary

artery graft.  Since then, she has continued to have episodes of

intermittent abdominal discomfort.  She recently has undergone an

extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her

abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.  Trials

of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective. 

In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test

exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak

blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.  She had no

ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.  Over the past two weeks

however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome

(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now

includes radiation to her left shoulder.  The pain is not

exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity. 

The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest. 

Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a

cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.  Vance, Jennifer

MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069

 

Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin

dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's

contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.

 

Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,

NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.

 

Allergies:  None.

 

Cigarettes - none.  Ethanol - social.

 

Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,

mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one

brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother

dying from melanoma age 36.  The rest of her siblings and children

have not heart disease.

 

Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress. 

Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,

respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.  The neck is

supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right

greater than left bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows a

normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection

murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant

diastolic murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal no

appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  

 

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval

of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.  There are minor

nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  

 

Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of

variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and

dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.  She has had a

retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her

most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show

significant provokable ischemia.  Nonetheless, I am concerned that

her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia. 

I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and

I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive

studies.  In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin

dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive

antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.  Unless her variegata porphyria

precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po

q.d.  I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.  In

addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d. and

I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her

porphyria does not

preclude this.  She understands that if she has evidence for

significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her

to undergo repeat coronary angiography.  Thank you very much for

allowing me to assist in her care.

 

Sincerely yours,

Dear Wanda:

 

Mrs. Vance returns for routine follow up.  At the present time,

she continues to complain of exertional angina,  and states that

she is willing to consider undergoing cardiac catheterization.  As

you know, I had suggested this to her last November.  

 

She continues now on a regimen of Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Paxil

20 mg p.o. q.d., Humalog 10 units sub.q. q.a.m., NPH 25 units

sub.q. q.a.m., sliding scale CZI throughout the day, isosorbide

mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase,

Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Celexa.

 

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood

pressure right arm sitting 92/60, heart rate 75 and regular.  

Respirations 12 and unlabored.  Weight 109 pounds.  This is one

pound above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple. JVP 

is flat.  Carotids  with continuing right greater than left bruits. 

Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a normal, physiologically

split S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the

apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur.  The abdomen is

benign.  Extremities are without edema.   The pulses are intact. 

 

Electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm at a rate of 75, PR interval

.12, QRS .08, QT .34, axis 75 degrees.  There are lateral ST and T

wave changes compatible with strain or ischemia.  Compared to her

last electrocardiogram, there has been no significant change.

 

Impression:  Ms. Vance is a 48-year-old woman with a history of

variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, and significant

coronary artery disease.  She is status post intramammary artery

graft to her LAD, after developing restenosis at the site of a

balloon LAD angioplasty.  The results of the catheterization will

determine subsequent therapeutic recommendations.  She will have

her insulin dose on the morning of her scheduled catheterization.

 

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Dear Wanda:

Mr. Vance returns for followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.  She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.  Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.  After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.  Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.  As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.

Currently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d., and p.r.n. Motrin.

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.

Electrocardiogram is pending.

Impression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.  However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.  She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.  Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.  Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.  I have not further altered her medical regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Sincerely yours,
