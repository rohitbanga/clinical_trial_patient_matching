Mr. Xavier is a 71-year-old male coming in for the first time for 
evaluation and follow up for health maintenance.  He comes in without 
major complaints.  He is a gentleman from Eritrea who is now retired.  
He is a very active person.  He is able to walk 2-3 kilometers without any 
dyspnea on exertion, no chest pain, no shortness of breath.  He sleeps 
well.  There is no nocturia.  There is no orthopnea or PND.  There is 
currently no claudication.  He does say that he has a history of a left 
femoral/popliteal bypass done in January of 2083, one month after 
arriving from Eritrea.  This was due to chronic left lower extremity 
claudication.  Since then he has had no symptoms of claudication on both 
legs.  He does say that intermittently over the past 3-4 months he has had 
right knee pain mostly after sitting down for a long time.  No 
predominance of the AM right knee pain.  No erythema, no edema.  No 
fevers.  He has no other joint involvement.  He tells me that he has been 
told that he has low-grade diabetes that is being treated with diet, 
although on his presentation to the hospital last year he was found not be 
be diabetic.
 
His past medical history, as mentioned:
 
1.   Status post a left fempop.
2.   Status post right cataract surgery.
3.   History of diabetes.  Diet control in Eritrea.
 
Medications:  only multivitamins.
 
Smoking:  1 pack/day x 40 years.  He stopped one year ago and now smokes 
intermittently 2-3 cigarettes/day.  He has never had an alcohol abuse 
problem.  He is not a drug consumer.  
 
Physical exam:  He has an appearance that is appropriate to his age.  He 
is a very pleasant man in no acute distress.  His heart rate is 78.  His 
blood pressure is 160/80.  Respiratory rate 16.  His eyes have bilateral 
arcus, no clear-cut central cataract on the right, but on the left there 
is some opacity.  No funduscopic examination was done.  HEENT is 
unremarkable.  Neck exam is supple, nontender.  He has no bruits.  Normal 
thyroid gland.  He has no JVD.  His cardiac exam is regular rate and 
rhythm, no murmurs, no gallops, no rubs, normal S1 and S2.  His lung exam 
is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal exam is flat, supple, 
nontender, no organomegaly, normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  He has 
very faint trace left ankle edema where he has status post fifth digit 
amputation in the past in Eritrea.  There is no evidence of 
hypoperfusion.  There is normal color and normal temperature to the skin.  
There is crepitance upon passive motion of the right knee with no 
erythema, no edema.  His vital extremities are normal.  His pulse is 1+ on 
the right posterior tibialis and nonpalpable on the left.  His popliteals 
on the right and the left are normal.

Assessment and Plan: 
 
1.   Mild systolic hypertension.  At this time I will observe and follow 
     this blood pressure.  I will get a cholesterol level, a renal and a 
     CBC.
 
2.   History of diet-controlled diabetes.  I will obtain glycemia today.  
     He is 8 hours fasting.  
 
3.   Right knee pain.  This is likely due secondary to osteoarthritis.  I 
     am recommending Tylenol for pain.  
 
4.   Peripheral vascular disease.  I am recommending 1 aspirin q.d. for 
     his PVD as well as lowering cardiac risk.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a
76-year-old male who presented to Orlando Regional this
evening for diabetes followup.  He denies any known drug
allergies and at present, he is taking Feratab 300 mg
t.i.d., Motrin 600 mg q.8h. p.r.n., Benadryl 50 mg q.h.s.
p.r.n., Zestril 5 mg q.d., glyburide 2.5 mg q.d., and
aspirin 325 mg q.o.d.  The patient has been followed fairly
frequently in the clinic recently for diabetic foot ulcers
on his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe.  This
evening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and
also a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes.  It has not
improved with good skin care and application of bacitracin;
in fact, it has worsened.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any bleeding with brushing of
his teeth.  He denies any palpitations or chest pain.  He
denies any shortness of breath or cough.  He denies any
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He states that
his bowel movements have become darkened secondary to his
iron intake.  He denies any symptoms of frequency or
nocturia, no burning, itching, or pain with urination.  He
states that he has occasional elbow pain, which is relieved
with Motrin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 97.8 degrees, his
pulse is 88, his blood pressure is 135/65, weight is 141
pounds, and his random blood sugar is 159.  He states that
he did not take his medication today.  His heart has a
regular rate and rhythm at 88.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  There are bruises noted on his
right hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of
these were related to trauma.  Examination of his feet
revealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny,
shinier than previous visits.  They were cool to touch.  On
his right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the
4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the
other side.  There was an increase in the size on the toe
ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.  Scant amount of
drainage was noted from the toe areas.  Mr. Nicholas Xavier
is vigilant with his foot care and has been so.  This is
definite worsening of his symptoms.  Posterior tibial pulses
are present.

ASSESSMENT
1. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Diabetic foot ulcers on 4th toe, both sides, and 5th toe.

PLAN: Arterial vascular studies with Doppler imaging to be
done.  Referral to surgical clinic for evaluation of his
ulcers.  He was given a prescription for Xeroform gauze to
be used twice daily and dressing changes were explained to
him.  He was instructed to return to clinic in one month for
followup.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
left foot ulceration.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d. and Actos 30 mg
q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
changed, but there are no new signs of infection.  He has been
taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. for the last seven days.  He denies
fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
little bit.  His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.

He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.  I have
asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
vascular status.  I have also reviewed with him that he may need
to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.

Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
until the end of this month.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.  In the meantime, he will
continue with all his medications.  I have given him a
prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d. since the pharmacy could not
give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594

 

Dear Dr. Vanpelt,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 

recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. I followed him in the hospital 

when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.  As you know, he is a 77 

year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 

hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 

lower extremity bypasses in the past. 

 

He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 

for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.  His preoperative evaluation 

included 

a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 

induced 

hypokinesis in the inferior wall.  Since this was a small area, it was felt 

he 

could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.  He 

underwent 

left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 

with 

no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.

 

However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 

35 and a troponin of 19.5.  As a result of his large troponin leak, he 

underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 

main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 

artery, 

100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 

posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 

PDA. 

 

Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 

45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.  Due to 

his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 

on 

Apr 20, 2091. He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 

graft to his obtuse marginal artery.  He did not have a graft to his 

posterior 

descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary

to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.

 

Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 

April 

27, 2091.  His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 

Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 

morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.

 

Since that time, he has done quite well. He has been progressing at 

rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 

per 

day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 

his house.  He denies any chest pain with walking.  He has no shortness of 

breath or dyspnea on exertion.  He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 

long 

time and this is unchanged.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 

claudication symptoms with walking at this time.  He does complain of some 

pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation. He 

has 

plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.

On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 

60. 

 His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 

without carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 

bilaterally.  His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 

rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.  His 

chest 

incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well. He 

has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 

well.  There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 

does not appear to be cellulitic.  His feet are warm.

 

His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 

in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 

unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.

 

In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 

hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 

disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 

three 

weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.  

He 

will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 

time. I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 

and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline. 

 

I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 

his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.  I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 

regimen so I have changed his

Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d. and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o. 

q.d..  He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 

develops 

any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 

concerns.

 

He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.  Thank you for 

allowing me to participate in his care.

 

Sincerely,
