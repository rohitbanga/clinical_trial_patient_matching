NAME:     Espinal, Sandra

MRN:      4718200



MEDICATIONS:  Per LMR.

Medications

Prilosec (OMEPRAZOLE) 20MG, 1 Capsule(s) PO BID

Clonazepam 0.5MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO BID x 30 day(s) PRN prn anxiety, up to bid

Bromfed-pd BLANK take 1 cap po q 12 hours prn

Prozac (FLUOXETINE Hcl) 20MG, 2 Capsule(s) PO QD

Glucovance (GLYBURIDE/METFORMIN) 2.5-500MG, 2 Tablet(s) PO BID

Vioxx (ROFECOXIB) 25MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO bid x 15 day(s)

Norflex (ORPHENADRINE Citrate) 100MG, 1 Tablet(s) PO Q12H 







S:   (1)  Patient here complaining of increased neck pain with paresthesias of her

          left arm and tingling of her third and fourth left fingers.  This often

          occurs at the end of the week, when has been at the computer all week

          and then has to take her Vioxx and Norflex for the next two or three

          days, into the weekend.  Patient becoming very frustrated regarding this.

          Did not keep follow-up with Dr. Espinosa, the neurosurgeon she

          initially saw. 



     (2)  Diabetes: Patient had her first eye exam yesterday with Dr. Dunn, who

          actually is an optometrist.  He is referring her to a retinal specialist, due

          to a question of cystoid macular edema, due to diabetic retinopathy and

          some possible borderline intraocular pressures.  The patient is very

          concerned regarding this. Is worried about her heart and kidneys, now

          that she is having problems with her eyes.  Is trying to stick to her diet,

          but is worried. Blood sugars at home have been mostly in the 200's,

          occasionally high 100's. Patient does not bring her record with her. 



O:   Patient refuses to be weighed. BP, RA sitting 128/90. Lungs: Clear to A&P.

     COR: AP 96, NSR. Positive tenderness and spasm to left trapezius muscle.

     Feet: No lesions. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.  



A/P: (1)  Chronic neck and shoulder pain with intermittent paresthesias, with

          MRI showing some chronic degenerative changes, but also mild

          impingement of the subarachnoid space, possibly even at the cord at C5-6.

          Lengthy discussion with patient regarding this being chronic problem

          and need to follow up with Dr. Espinosa.  Will refer to P.T., not only

          for therapy, but also to re-evaluate ergonomics of her work site, as this

          may help. Continue all other medications, with ice, heat and home

          exercises.  Consulted with Dr. Moses, who suggested a TENS Unit may

          be helpful.  Will discuss further with patient. 



     (2)  AODM: Now with diabetic retinopathy. Lengthy discussion of 20 to 30

          minutes with patient regarding implications of this, as well as need for

          better diabetic control, especially, as poorly-controlled diabetes is quietly

          harming both her heart and her kidneys, as well as her blood vessels. 

          Patient seems more motivated now to try to adhere to diet and exercise.

          Refer to Dr. Larry Kowalski, a retinal specialist, as soon as possible. Patient

          promises to do her bloodwork for her RFT's, fasting lipids, FBS,

          hemoglobin A1C, as well as urine microalbumin.  Will follow up with

          Dr. Moses and with me afterwards.

PCP: Kelsey Ito

Neuro: Umberto Xuan



CC: fall with LOC



HPI: Pt is a 56 yo woman with a PMH significant for multiple cardiac risk factors, including IDDM, with a HbA1C of 10.7 earlier this month, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, whose insulin dose was increased 3 weeks ago.  Her blood sugars have subsequently been low, reaching the 50s on several occasions.  At these times, she experiences diaphoresis and dizziness.  The pt took her morning insulin as usual, ate her normal breakfast, and at 4:30pm was walking to the kitchen when she got dizzy and felt her legs    turn to jelly.     She felt herself falling, yelled out to her son and landed on her left arm.  She lost consciousness.  Her son found her unresponsive and witnessed her vomit twice, drool, mumble and lose bladder continence.  She regained consciousness a few minutes later and was placed in an ambulance, where her BS was found to be 91.  She was brought to the DDCH ED, where plain films showed a fractured left humerus and a head CT was negative for bleed.     



She denies CP, SOB or palpitations.  At baseline, the pt is able to walk one mile and climb three flights of stairs without SOB or CP.

TSH 3.5

ESR 60 (7/76)

Urine microalbumin 6.8, microalb/Cr ration 76.4

Studies:

Plain film humerus- fracture through the diaphysis of the left humerus.  There is lucency which could represent underlying lesion.  

CXR- NAD

Head CT- negative

10/90- stress- 7 mets- no chest pain, no ECG changes, imaging- apparently reversible anterior defect- likely breast attenutation

5/90- echo- EF 75%, no valvular abnl.

EGD- 11/93- erythematous gastropathy



Assessment: 56 yo woman with chronically high blood sugars, who now, in the setting of recently increased insulin and low blood sugars, presents with fall and LOC, likely a hypoglycemic seizure.



Plan:

Syncope- most likely etiology hypoglycemic seizure.  Given pt's markedly elevated HbA1C, blood sugars likely very high chronically.  Now with tight glycemic control, including blood sugars in the 50s, pt likely seized.  Other worrisome etiologies would include cardiac- has multiple risk factors, but no data supporting CAD (enzymes negative, ECG no change, no signs/symptoms of CHF, no valvular disease, no history of arrhythmias)  Will continue rule out MI.  Don't think TTE necessary.  Also, could be cerebrovascular disease, although imaging of cerebral vasculature has been mostly normal.  Head CT negative for bleed.  Will discuss EEG with pt's neurologist in am.



Left humerus fracture- reduction by ortho in ED.  Pt should sleep in upright position (per ortho).  Percocet for pain control.



DM- have cut pt's home insulin in 1/3 (do not want to run too low).  SSI for additional coverage.



HTN- cont outpt anti-hypertensives.



Anemia- stable- iron not deficient.  



Hyperlipidemia- cont statin.



Prophylaxis- nexium, fragmin vs ambulation.
