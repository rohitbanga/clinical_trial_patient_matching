ED Attending Physician Note

HPI

Patient was admitted to the observation unit at JCH overnight because of his complaints of chest pain.  Plan had been to cycle enzymes and provocative testing, however, this am patient adamantly refused to stay in hospital and understanding leaving included incomplete evaluation of chest pain and risk of death, patient signed out AMA.



I left the obseration unit to walk downstairs and find patient signing into the ER "I want to go to detox"

Asked patient why he left OU to just come back to the hospital and he said "There is nothing wrong with my heart".



Patient also reports he thought he had a place to stay but after making a few phone calls, realized he had nowhere to go to spend the night.



No new complaints including no chest pain or shortness of breath
