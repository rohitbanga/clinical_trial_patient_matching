The patient returns for a follow up visit on her diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.  She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June.  She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin.  The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.  Blood sugars are often 60 or less.  The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.



Physical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96.  Glucose done in the exam room today was 110.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, negative S3, S4, and no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities: No edema and nontender.  Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.  The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.  I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.  Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.

2.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.  She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.

3.  Tendonitis, right middle finger.  After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

4.  Anemia.  This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.  She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.  We will check CBC today.

5.  Right shoulder pain.  The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.

6.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  The patient will follow up with me in about two months.

EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.

Forrest.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the

patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's

chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple

medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.  At her

rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent

here.  The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable

for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent

hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the

end of December through the beginning of January.  The patient's

chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the

patient has been doing well at rehab since.  However, today was

noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.  She had

shortness of breath as well.  Her oxygen saturations improved

marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to

nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.  The patient was

treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement

and is noted to be quite tachypneic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,

diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,

anemia, and cervical fracture.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited

by the severity of the patient's presentation.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,

Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,

Colace, and Xalatan.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some

degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and

answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.  Vital signs are as

documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,

and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.  HEENT exam is

atraumatic, normal to inspection.  The patient has a large tongue

and her uvula is not visible at all.  Neck is immobilized in a

C-collar and is obese.  Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath

sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory

use.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without

murmur.  Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.  Abdomen is

soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or

masses, or guarding, or rebound.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry

without any lesions or rash.  Musculoskeletal exam reveals

tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib

fractures.  Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty

speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic

deficit.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.  White

blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is

at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.  LFTs within

normal limit.  INR 1.2.  D-dimer significantly elevated.  EKG

demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which

are present previously but possibly slightly increased.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given

Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was

also started on CPAP.  She seemed to be improving clinically for

some period of time but then began to decline in her mental

status.  At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia. 

Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient

likely needed intubation.  We had hope to hold off to do a

thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines

such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the

procedure.  On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable

throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory

distress.  Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex

her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful

in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in

between those attempts.  For full details of the procedure,

please see the attached procedure note.  Thoracic Surgery was

consulted.  They arrived as the patient was being intubated.  At

this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to

determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural

effusion and whether it is loculated.  This study will be

performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in

the ICU.  A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and

the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural

effusion.

FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

EDVISIT^10776605^GLENN, OLIVIA^04/15/80^URIBE, HAROLD

Seen by me along with Dr. Oglesby on 04/15/2080.  The history as

documented by Dr. Oglesby was reviewed by me with the patient and

found to be accurate and complete.  The physical exam was

confirmed by my examination.  Evaluation and management was also

concurred with.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 66-year-old woman

who enters with recent three-month history of admission for

respiratory failure, pneumonia, and MSSA bacteriemia, discharged

from rehab two weeks ago, presents with two to three day history

of shortness of breath; dyspnea on exertion; PND; orthopnea; and

leg edema, improving, but complains of occasional chest tightness

lasting about an hour, worse with exertion.  No nausea and no

vomiting.  Nonradiating.  Seen by VNA today, blood pressure was

190/100 and sent her here for evaluation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Does not smoke and does not drink.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of atrial fibrillation,

hypertension, diabetes, CHF, asthma, and chronic renal

insufficiency, the baseline creatinine is 2.5.

Review of systems, allergies, and medications are as documented

in the chart.  Please see the notes for details.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake and alert, well-developed,

well-nourished woman in mild respiratory distress.  Pulse 93,

respirations 18 to 20, blood pressure 158/83, and O2 saturation

100% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  JVP at 10 cm.  Lung exam shows

rales to one-third of the way up to the lung bases. 

Cardiovascularly, regular rate and rhythm.  The rest of the exam

is as documented in the chart other than pedal edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows sinus rhythm and left anterior

fascicular hemiblock with flattening at V2.  Chest x-ray shows

pulmonary vascular congestion.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  As such, she was admitted to

Medicine with a diagnosis of decompensated CHF, likely secondary

to hypertension.  Her blood pressure initially when she came in

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DISPOSITION:  She was admitted on 04/15/2080.
