RILEY,MARY   631-07-92-1                      VISIT DATE: 02/13/62
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 58-year-old 
non-English-speaking Hispanic woman who presents for evaluation of 
waxing and waning epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain 
for the past five days.  The patient was in her usual state of 
health until one week ago, when she developed an upper respiratory 
tract infection.  She was seen by her primary care physician, who 
treated her with Biaxin.  The patient took the Biaxin; however, she 
developed some epigastric abdominal pain on Tuesday.  She called 
her primary care physician, who attributed her abdominal pain to a 
Biaxin reaction.  She was told to discontinue the Biaxin on Thursday. 
The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
or constipation.  She denies any dysuria, polyuria, or hematuria. 
She denies any vaginal discharge.  She denies any shortness of 
breath or chest pain.  She denies any arm, jaw, or back pain.  She 
denies any diaphoresis or dizziness.  She does admit to some 
burping and indigestion. 
She describes the pain as cramping in nature.  It waxes and wanes. 
It does not radiate anywhere.  Nothing seems to improve or worsen 
the pain. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, and otherwise negative.  In 
particular, on cardiovascular review, she denies chest pain, arm 
pain, jaw pain, or back pain; she denies any diaphoresis, 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea on exertion, or palpitations. 
On pulmonary, she admits to cough, but denies hemoptysis.  The 
abdominal review is as per the HPI; she denies melena.  The GU 
review is as per HPI. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (1) Type I diabetes mellitus; (2) 
Hypertension; (3) Hypothyroidism; (4) Asthma; (5) Current upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler; glucophage; insulin; codeine. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative tobacco.  The family 
history is negative for diabetes mellitus. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the vital signs 
reveal a temperature of 98.6 degrees F., a blood pressure of 
146/74, a pulse of 88, and a respiratory rate of 20.  The O2 
saturation is 96% on room air.  In general, the patient is in no 
acute distress.  The HEENT examination reveals the head to be 
normocephalic; the examination is atraumatic.  EOMI.  PERLA.  The 
throat is clear.  The neck is supple, with no JVD or bruits.  The 
chest shows no crepitus or retractions.  The lungs have coarse 
breath sounds.  The heart has a regular rhythm and rate without 
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, with some very 
mild epigastric tenderness, but no guarding, rebound, referred 
pain, flank tenderness, palpable masses, or pulsatile masses.  The 
extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis, clubbing, 
or edema.  On neurologic, there are no focal findings. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The chest x-ray shows no acute pathology. 
The EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 90. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The working diagnosis was peptic 
ulcer disease exacerbation versus gastritis versus non-specific 
abdominal pain.  The patient was status post cholecystectomy five 
years ago.  She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She did 
not exhibit any stigmata of an acute coronary syndrome; however, 
given her history of diabetes mellitus and her age, an EKG was 
obtained and revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90, without any 
ischemic or infarctive changes.  She was medicated with 30 cc of 
Maalox and 150 mg of Axid, which seemed to improve her pain 
considerably.  Serial abdominal examinations did not reveal any 
peritoneal signs or worsening abdominal pain.  The patient did not 
have any medical records on the computer at this time.  Nursing and 
Triage notes were reviewed and I concur in those findings. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal pain, suspect gastritis versus peptic 
ulcer disease. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
given abdominal pain instructions in Spanish.  She was given a 
prescription for Axid and for Maalox.  She was to follow up with 
her primary care physician the next day and return if symptoms were 
to recur or worsen.  She was discharged in improved and stable 
condition.

Record date: 2069-12-24

CC: Shortness of breath, neck pain.



HPI:  Ms. Riley was recently hospitalized in 11/69 for neck pain, chest pain, and SOB.  She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia.  Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%.  On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.  Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.  She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.  SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.  2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.  She feels "her veins exploding".  Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home.  She says most of her symptoms resolved.  Per her husband, she has always been a fairly anxious person.  



ROS: No DOE, no PND, no fever.  Good apetite, polydypsia. Blurry vision.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  A total thyroidectomy, on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, COPD, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, cholecystectomy and a meniscal tear.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS (updated)

1) Albuterol inhaler

2) Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily

3) Clonidine HCL 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.

4) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily

5) Flovent 220 mcg b.i.d.

6) Levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily

7) Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily

8) Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily, 

9) Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

10) Humulin 70/30  90 U sc qAM, 70 U sc QPM

11) Metformin 1000 mg PO BID

12) SL NTG 0.3





SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years. Lives with her husband. Denies any tobacco or alcohol.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

Weight: 215 lbs.  P 73, BP 122/74, SO2 97% RA

Gen: Well nourished.  Apperas well. Not pale. Obese

HEENT: PERRL. MMM. No LAN

Chest: CTA BL

CV: JVP flat. RRR. 2/6 systolic murmur LUSB. no r/g. S1 + single S2.

Abd: Soft. Non-tender. Obese.

Extrem: Warm. 1+ non-pitting edema.





IMPRESSION:  Ms. Riley is a 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence of insulin resistance, most recent hemoglobin A1c was 9.4.  Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.  Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.  My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.  Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.   We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.  Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.



In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.  She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.  Her next appointment is in January.  HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.  Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.  For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.. 







      

========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================

Discussed with Dr. Freddie Eric. 66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM. Recent admission for R/O MI. A1C was in the 9s. Being followed by Internal Medicine. Has odd sensation of numbness climbing from her toes to her chest associated with SOB and a sense that her neck is exploding. It would appear that she is having anxiety. We will treat with fluoxetine and Klonopin and refer to Psych. We will also adjust her insulin further.

Record date: 2070-11-29

 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman who presents to Internal Medicine for followup.  Since her last visit, she has continued on her regimen of 70/30, 90 units in the morning and up to 90 units at dinnertime (sometimes 1/2 after dinner).  She also uses Lispro 25 units at lunch.  On this regimen, her morning blood sugars have ranged 
Pre-breakfast: 96-214, mostly 100-130.
Pre (sometimes post) Dinner: 128-307, mostly 140-160

The good news is her last A1c dropped to 7.2% from 8.3% (1 year ago was 10.4%)

She has known retinopathy and has had multiple laser treatments.  She goes routinely to the ophthalmologist, at least twice a year and several times a year to the podiatrist as well. She is otherwise in good health, though today she complains of depressed mood, for which she is in therapy. 

On ROS she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, fevers, chills, diarrhea, vaginal or urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling of her lower extremities.  She has not had any hypoglycemia.  She does not exercise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post total thyroidectomy (because of large goiter) on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily. COPD, obesity, CHF (EF 40%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, status post cholecystectomy.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler, Ambien, atenolol 50 mg daily, clonidine 0.2 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, Flovent b.i.d., levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 20 mg p.o. nightly, Metormin 1000 mg BID, Lasix 20 mg daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years and denies tobacco or alcohol.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing overweight woman.  Blood pressure 117/57, pulse 87, weight 210 down fr 212 last visit, fingersticks 247 postprandial, reports took lispro today.  Extremities, no edema, well perfused with palpable pulses.  No ulcerations or skin breakdown. Microfilament and vibratory sensation intact.  

PREVIOUS DATA:  Labs from 11/22/70: TSH 0.137.  Microalbumin was negative.  Cholesterol was 109, LDL 40, HDL 36, TG 163 A1c 7.2%, down from 8.3% on 7/31/2070 

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  In summary, Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years with poor glycemic control, but significant improvement recently, with latest hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%.

1.  Diabetes.  Her sugars are much improved, as is her A1c. We will switch her 70/30 regular to 70/30 Novolog, given that she gives herself the insulin just after the meals and that she is using Novolog for lunch as well. We emphasized again the pm dose should NOT be pre-bed but pre-dinner.  She will continue dose of 90 units QAM and Qdinner of 70/30 and Lispro 25U for lunch. She will continue on metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She will continue to follow up with Opthalmology and Podiatry.  Her blood pressure is in target range on clonidine and lisinopril.  Her LDL is also in target range on Lipitor.   She will continue on a baby aspirin. Her microalbumin is negative.   

2.  Hypothyroidism.  TSH somewhat suppressed, 0.137, will therefore reduce levothyroxine to 175 mcg QD

She will follow up in 3-4 month's time.
