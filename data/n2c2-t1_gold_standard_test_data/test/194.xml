Name: Crawford, Patrick	

MR #: 9021555

Date of admission: 9/5/92

Intern: Shawn Ott

Attending: Yarger, Kathryn

 

CC:  Syncope



HPI:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for DM (diet control only) and HTN, who has been in his usual state of health until the day of admission, when he went to the grocery store to shop with his sisters and lost consciousness and fell on the ground.  He said he has been perfectly fine, in his usual self, when he went to the grocery store, although the days have been humid.  He has AC at home.  However, about 5-10 minutes before he fell, he felt    hot    and    sweaty   , but didn't think too much of it.  After finishing shopping in the store, he went out to the car to open the trunk, and while he was trying to put the key in the keyhole, he lost consciousness and fell to the ground. According to the witnesses at the scene (his sisters), he lost consciousness for about 1-2 minutes, and he quickly came back to himself but did not remember what had happened to him.  No head trauma.  



Other than feeling hot and sweaty, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, vision changes, focal limb weakness, slurring of speech, and bowel or bladder incontinence.  No prior event similar to this, although w/ h/o vertigo dx in 2090.  He said he has been drinking his usual amount of fluid (but not more than usual) and did not notice any lightheadedness or dizziness at home.



At the ED, his vitals were stable, with T97.4, HR 66, BP 126/61, R 16, and 100% on RA.  He felt completely back to his normal himself, but complained of L ankle pain when he walked.

CXR: Clear.



CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.



TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.



A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.   



1. Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.  It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.  However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.  Ischemic event is less likely in this man.  EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.

Other possible causes include:

  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.  However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.

  	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.  

Plan:

1)	Continue hydration overnight. 

2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.

3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.

4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.

5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.



2. DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.  Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.  Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.  

1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI.

2)     Q6h finger stick check.

3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.



3. L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.  Tender to palpation and with joint movement.  No signs of infection.  Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.

1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture.

2)     PT consult.



4. FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).  Eating PO.  On IVF for hydration.

1)	Replete Mg.  

2)     K now 3.6.  If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.

3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.



5. Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin. 



8. Dispo: PT consult.  Anticipate home discharge.

Internal Medicine - MSIII Admission Note



Pt: Crawford, Patrick (Mary 3562Z)

MR#: 	902-15-55

Date of Admission: 10/10/92

Attending: 	Yancey, Ursula

PCP: Estep, Willa

Code status: Full





CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis



HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.  He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.  He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.  He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.  He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.  He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.  When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.



One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.  Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.  As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.  According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.  He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.  He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.  Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.  At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.



In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.  He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.  He has had no other symptoms.  Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.  He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.  Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.  Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.  No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.  No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.  Stable Hct.  Likely etiologies include:



1.	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.  EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.  Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.  Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.



2.	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.  Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.



3.	Prazosin-induced hypotension.  In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.



4.	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.





Plan:



Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers

		- Telemetry

		- 24 hr Holter monitor

		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler

		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m.

		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr

		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient

		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd



DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m.

		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet



OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN



Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol



Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc.

Internal Medicine Admission Note

Name: Crawford, Patrick
MR#:  9021555
Date of Admission: 04.15.94 
PCP: Ehlers, Willa
Attending: Ward
Admitting Resident: Kimberly Ring

CC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope

HPI:  
83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. 
In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. 
ED Course:
Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted. 

ROS: 
Negative in detail; positives noted in HPI. 

Medical History:
1. CAD: Adenosine mibi showed reversible, moderate, anteroseptal defect. Cath 10/92 with mild to moderate LAD (focal 50% stenosis in proximal third; focal 50% stenosis of mid third at ostia of second diaganol artery) and RCA (proximal RCA w/ 50% stenosis in distal third) disease; interrogation with pressure wire of LAD lesion revealed non-hemodynamically signficiant lesion. Discharged from SDU on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ Dr. Youmans (who has followed since).
2. Syncope: Admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker and dehydration, second time ruled out, but had positive adenosine mibi (see above)
. - 	3. DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.  HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.
4. Hypertension
5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. TIA workup 8/2090 after p/w sensation of burning tongue, metallic taste, some diminished hearing on L, had negative head CT at OSH per pt
7. Vertigo: dx in 10/2090, described as dizziness/room spinning.  No subsequent episodes.  Negative CTA of the head/neck at SOH.
8. BPH
9. Lung cancer, s/p L lobectomy (middle and lower lobes) in 2072, did not require chemotherapy or radiation
10. OA, s/p R total hip replacement (2086)
11. Gout: involves L big toe, but with rare flares
12. Glaucoma OU
13.  Cataracts OU, s/p cataract surgery
14. Double hernia repair 6/85
15. S/p shrapnel injury to L side of body during the war, reports retained shrapnel near C-spine, L arm, scalp.  Has no permanent injury, but did limp for awhile after being injured which has resolved.
16. Herpes zoster flare 15yrs ago
17. Mastoiditis as child

ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     

Chest xray: Clear

Assessment & Plan
83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting. Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features. However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.

Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
Has completed MI r/o
Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis. Afebrile. Hemodynamically stable. U/A and chest xray negative
Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
Fen/Renal
Replete Mg
Proph: Lovenox, nexium

	SOUTH OAKS HOSPITAL
	


	Interval History:
   Mr. Crawford returns to the clinic for routine scheduled follow-up.  His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective. He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home. He did not require transfusion. The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred. Otherwise, his health is unchanged.  He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.

	

	Changes to Allergies
	
BRIMONIDINE TARTRATE - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]
Latex - reaction: Rash [reviewed]
no known allergies: He has no current allergies - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   50, which is strong and regular
-resp. rate:   12.  He is saturating 100% at room air
-Extremities:   There is trace dependent 1+ lower extremity swelling, which is stable.
-Abdomen:   Soft and nontender.
-Cardiac:   Regular with nondisplaced PMI, 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the base with the crisp S2.
-Chest:   His lungs are clear.
-Neck:   Jugular venous pressure is 7 cm of water with normal AV contour.  He has 2+ carotids with brisk upstrokes.
-Heent:   Normocephalic.
-General:   He is alert and appropriate in no apparent distress
-BP: 138/72    in the right arm seated


	EKG:
   Sinus bradycardia at 50. Delayed R-wave progression. Leftward axis. Nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.

Selected recent labs:
	
		
	


	Impression:
   1.) Nonobstructive CAD
2.) Neurocardiogenic syncope
3.) Hypertension


	Assessment and plan:
   Overall he is doing well his cardiovascular issues are stable.  His blood pressure slightly above goal but given his past syncopal tendencies with aggressive lowering will hold off on any med changes for now.  I will see him back in six months, sooner if new issues arise.

   Mr. Crawford returns to the clinic for routine scheduled follow-up.  His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he continues to do well from a CV perspective. He has had free of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He has had no recurrent symptomatic diverticulosis. He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.  He is unfortunately not able to do any gardening this year due to progressive joint pain and stiffness. He was recently seen by Dr. Powers (nephrology) after a recent mild bump in his creatinine. His renal workup is ongoing.

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   55, which is strong and regular
-resp. rate:   12.  He is saturating 100% at room air
