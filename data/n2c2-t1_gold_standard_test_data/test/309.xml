The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up. She has been having
symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
clear history of her symptoms. At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
fall over to her right side. There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
symptoms. She has not actually had syncope. There is no positional component to her
symptoms. I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms. The
MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
ovale and bilateral pontine region. She had small chronic lacunar infarcts. She reports
that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. She had some left internal carotid
mild 30% proximal stenosis. Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts. Most likely related to hypertension rather
than embolic disease. Her blood pressure has been very well controlled. In fact, today
on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60. She brought her medications with her and
has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. She had not taken her medications today and
her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
the left. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Her lungs are clear without
wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1, S2. 
       
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension. Now with lower blood
pressure and some lightheadedness. We will d/c her atenolol. I would like her to get a
repeat blood pressure in one week. I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
diabetes. She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian

female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness. Her daughter,

who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today. Apparently, for

many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of "feeling pulled"

when she walks. This never occurs when lying down or sitting. It is only when she is

walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or

backward. At times, she does visibly veer when she walks. She has had one fall a

number of months ago when she broke her wrist. She has not had any subsequent

falls. There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,

numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache. She actually

feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it

was a little more severe. Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.

Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms. 



Review of other systems notable for general fatigue. Otherwise unremarkable. No

chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

hyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts. 



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,

Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx. 



FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease. 



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece. She neither drinks nor

smokes. 



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,

72-year-old female. BP 140/84. Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,

except for decreased hearing on the left. On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift. Good

power throughout upper and lower extremities. She does, however, seem mildly

bradykinetic diffusely. Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric. Amplitude

is normal for finger tapping. Power in the lower extremities 5/5. Sensory exam with

mild vibratory loss in the toes. Finger-to-nose testing intact. Foot-tapping decreased

bilaterally. Romberg sway. Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to

either side. She is unable to perform tandem. DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+

ankle jerks. Babinski flexor bilaterally. 



DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter

hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral

pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right

internal capsule and bilateral thalami. Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the

anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the

posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment

stenosis of the basilar artery. Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134. 8/30

bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits. LFT's normal except SGOT

elevated at 46. 



IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and

hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady. She is

symptomatic only when she walks. Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the

toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the

wide-based, at times veering gait. It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are

multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.

It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given

that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she

is concerned about.  However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,

she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she

became hypotensive. As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding

Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she

can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine. I will see her in follow up in two

months to see how she is doing. May also consider checking CBC, given her

symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

NAME:    Wilson, Gabriel

MRN:     8514931



The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems. She has a history of TIAs and

was seeing the neurologist today for follow up. She has not had recent TIA symptoms

but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.

Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she

has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she

walks about one block. The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both

sides of her chest. It is not severe, sharp chest pain. It does not radiate to her back.

There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain. No PND, orthopnea or edema.

The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago. She has a history of TIAs and our

goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a

low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.



She is on aspirin and Plavix.



She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.

She has not had a recent stress test.  



PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood

pressure is 160/70. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs clear without wheezes,

rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur

or gallop. Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema.  



Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story

which sounds convincing for exertional angina. She has not had any symptoms in over

two weeks. Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She should stop it if she

feels lightheaded on the medication. She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d. We

will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT. She will follow-up in one week.

Visit Note



Patient Name: WILSON, GABRIEL                        MRN: 8514931

Dictated Date: 06/29/2097                      Dictated By: Julie Fraser, M.D.



Date of Visit: 06/28/2097





 Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today. Her daughter Gibbs was translating. She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems. She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past. 



Recently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house. They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication. When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not. Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol. Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning. She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars. She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low. She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat. She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range. She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249. The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner. 



The patient reports that she feels dizzy at times. She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating. She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations. Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down. No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness. 



Of note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved. 



Her cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response. No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images. From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length. She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid. Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct. 



The patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia. Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not. Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia. 



She also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital. 



On exam she is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 124/60. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No CCE. She has chronic right facial weakness consistent with her known Bell's palsy. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 otherwise intact though vision was not assessed. Motor 5/5. Reflexes 1+, absent ankle jerks, downgoing toes. Gait is slightly wide based which is consistent with the prior note from Dr. Hope Kincaid. Sensation intact to light touch. Distal pulses intact. 



1. Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen. Continue same. Check Chem-7. 



Type 2 diabetes. Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low. Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar. 



Lightheadedness and dizziness. We are going to check a Chem-7 and then repeat an MRI/MRA of her head and neck. 



She should follow up in neurology and also with her counselor. She will follow up with me in a few weeks after the MRI/MRA.
