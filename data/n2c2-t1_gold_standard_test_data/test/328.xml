UA: 1.010, pH 7.0, negative dipstick; micro showed few bacteria, few squams and 0-2 WBCs 



EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. 1st degree AV block. Left axis deviation with likely left anterior fascicular block. No priors available for comparison.



Imaging:

Chest X-Ray: No evidence of pneumonia.



Hip films: Impacted, displaced fracture of the left femoral neck with longitudinal extension of fracture into the intertrochanteric proximal femur. 



TTE 6/77: Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.





Impression:

87F with PMHx of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, hypothyroidism, chronic venous stasis, and h/o post-op DVT presents with L proximal femur fracture after fall. Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history. Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure. Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital. Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history. This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.



Recommendations:

-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100

-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively

-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID

-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive



Thank you for this interesting consult. To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.

She was found to have a displaced femoral neck fx on left and underwent an uneventful hemiarthroplasty; her post-op course was notable for Post-operative course was remarkable for LENIs on POD #2 found negative for DVT and 2-u pRBC transfusion for HCT of 23 with appropriate response.  She was discharged to MEDIQUIK on 7/2/77. 
On the day prior to admission (7/12), the pt was noted to be fatigued by the rehab staff; she recalls feeling tired but &#8220;not too bad.&#8221;  Her hct was noted to have dropped from 30.4 &#224; 24.6 (baseline post-op hct ~30).  She was sent to the MARY ED, where she was tachy to the 100s, sBP 120s, guiaiac negative, and xray/CT revealed 750 cc fluid extending from the proximal third of the thigh to the hip, with Houdsfield units suggesting hematoma.  Pt denies dyspnea, CP, lightheadedness, fever, chills, sweats.  She received 1 unit pRBC (increase hct from 24.6&#224;28) and was admitted to Educare-Fargo A for further management.

MICROBIOLOGY

Urine culture MEDIQUIK 7/10: &gt;100,000 mixed 3 organisms (contamination)



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES



Left hip xray (7/13): 
Status post left hip replacement. New bony fragment (since 6/29/77)

     superior to the left femur, likely from the greater trochanter



Left hip CT (7/13):  

1) heterogeneous density 6.6 x 8.9 cm intra-muscular soft tissue collection within the muscle planes in the left supero-lateral aspect of the left hip

2) smaller soft tissue collection within the subcutaneous fat anterolateral to the left hip measuring 4.7 x 7.9 cm

Impression: There at least two soft tissue collections are seen within the soft tissues surrounding the left total hip replacement, which have high density components likely representing hematomas.  The superior lateral collection appears intramuscular.  The inferolateral collection is within the subcutaneous fat.



TTE (6/2077): Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.



EKG

Irregular tachycardia with nml uniform appearing P-waves and narrow QRS; ?atrial tachycardia with variable block versus sinus tachycardia with dropped beats (similar pattern observed on EKG dated 6/29/77)

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

87F w h/o HTN, HLP, DM, hypothyroidism, and now 2 weeks s/p left hemiarthroplasty after L femoral neck fracture who p/w fatigue at MEDIQUIK and was found to have an 8.5-point hct drop. 




1) hct drop &#8211; likely post-op hematoma, unlikely other source of bleeding

- follow hct bid

- if pt c/o recurrent pain, or if exam changes, will obtain repeat hip xray

- transfuse if hct shows evidence of active bleeding (hct&lt;28 in AM) and symptomatic

- guaiac stools



2) s/p hemiarthroplasty

- WBAT per ortho

- PT consult for inpt assistance; maintain troch off precautions (no active abduction)

- f/u ortho recs from attending 7/14 AM



3) tachycardia &#8211; 2/2 anemia (resolving with stabilizing hct), volume depletion, post-op 

- follow telemetry

- replete lytes

- up-titrate beta-blocker if tachycardia persists on 7/14 following hct stabilization

- follow fever curve, CBC



4) heme

- started lovenox 30 mg bid on PM of 7/13 given risk of DVT (last anticoag 7/12 AM)

- d/w ortho re: risk of re-bleed versus risk of DVT



5) DM

- bid fingersticks, RISS if necessary



FEN: ADAT, D5NS at 80cc/hr for now



PPx

DVT: lovenox 30 bid for now

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Fall



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

                Pt is an 88 yo woman with a PMH of DM, HTN, mild dementia and baseline anxiety with a hx of falls who was admitted following a witnessed mechanical fall which resulted in a Type III dens fracture and R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. 
She was seen by ortho, and they recommended use of an Aspen collar for the dens fracture, and no operative management for the pubic ramus fracture.  On 11/15, patient was noted to have a decreased Hct, which was attributed to an expanding hematoma on her right thigh, and she was given 2 U of PRBCs from 9:30am-5pm on 11/15.  Overnight her O2 requirement increased from 2L to 4L, and she was given Lasix in response to a chest X-ray which showed signs of pulmonary edema.  Throughout the day patient became progressively more agitated, and in addition to her standing Seroquel (12.5 mg bid), she was also given two doses of Zyprexa (2.5mg and 5mg).  Overnight on 11/15-11/16 she became febrile, up to 103.5, peaking at 105.6 in the morning on 11/16, despite standing Tylenol.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken, and patient was started on Levoquin, Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, and transferred to Team E.

MICROBIOLOGY

Blood culture: No growth

Urine culture: No growth



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES

CXR

     IMPRESSION:

     

     Bilateral pulmonary edema, more prominent than 11/14/77



EKG

Initially unable to obtain because of pt&#8217;s tremor.  When more calm, EKG was irregular, no acute ST or T wave changes.

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

                88 yo female with a PMH of DM, HTN, severe anxiety and history of falls presenting with pubic ramus and dens fracture, now with new fevers, rigidity and tachycardia.



ISSUE #1: Fever and tremors.  Differential includes infection, seizure, NMS or serotonin syndrome.  A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.  An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.  In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.


Continue to follow lytes, CK, CBC
 
Small doses of Ativan for tremor/anxiety
 
AVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical)
 
Continue antibiotics, F/U cultures



ISSUE #2: Type III Dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.


Keep in C collar, manage rami fracture medically



ISSUE #3: DM.  Continue FSGs and RISS.





ISSUE #4: Anemia.  Continue to follow Hct and monitor hematoma on R thigh



PROPYLAXIS

DVT: Teds, Pneumoboots

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn



CODE:  Full code (discussion continuing with family)

Deformity of the odontoid process, consistent with old odontoid process fracture. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above. Indeterminate 5 mm nodule noted in the right lung apex, stable from the prior study dated 11/13/2077.6/14/78: CT head No acute intracranial abnormality identified. Nonspecific white matter changes, most likely representing chronic small vessel change in this age group.6/14/78: Cspine XR: No evidence of displaced fracture or malalignment.6/14/78: LS spine XR: No displaced lumbar spine fracture.6/14/78: ankle XR: 1. Posterior talus fracture. 2. Possible fractures of the posterior malleolus, distal fibula. 3. Subtalar subluxation. 4. Given the severe osteopenia, suggest CT scan for more definitive evaluation.6/14/78: CXR:   No evidence of traumatic injury in the chest6/14/78: hip/pelvis XR:  1.  Acute, comminuted right intertrochanteric hip fracture. 2.  Left hip hardware, appears intact. 3.  Healed pubic ramus fractures.6/14/78: ankle CT: No evidence of talar fracture or any other acute displaced fracture. There is patchy osteopenia.&#8226; EKG: 6/14/78 at 10:25AM: sinus ~@71, left axis, no ST changes.6/14/78 at 4:14PM: AF with RVR ~ 141 still no ischemic ST changes.ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN88F with dementia, HTN, hx multiple falls, s/p hip fx 2077, hx likely NMS in setting of haldol, p/w another fall, likely mechanical, and hip fx. We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1. Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD. Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions. Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412
