Ickes, Jr., William

81071628

02/02/79



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ickes comes in with pain in his right 

hip, left shoulder and for follow up of his coronary artery disease and 

his left wrist.  



His right hip continues to be painful at times.  A radiogram in December 

showed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip.  He has been taking 

Motrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.



His left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually 

is somewhat better than it has been.  It hurts to abduct him more than 

90 degrees or to reach behind his back.



His left wrist is bothering him some now.  It is sore with most types of 

motion.



Regarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this 

morning.



Regarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning.  He 

has had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 110/70, weight is 192 pounds, 

pulse is 70 and regular.  He is a pleasant black man in no apparent 

distress.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest 

is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiac, S1, S2, regular rate 

and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities, 

without edema.  Right hip, no pain with leg rolling.  Left shoulder is 

able to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to 

abduct completely with only minimal discomfort.  It is nontender to 

palpation.  Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint 

line.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:



1.	Right hip:  I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him 

to continue on the Motrin as needed.

	

2.	Left shoulder:  I may well have bursitis here.  He feels this has 

improved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different 

for now but will let me know if it causes more problems.

3.	Left wrist:  He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.  

He is tender in the joint line today.  It is bothering him a little 

bit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.

	

4.	Coronary disease:  He has been doing well from this prospective.  He 

has no recent chest pain, pressure or discomfort and his LDL has been 

very well controlled.

	

5.	Diabetes:  His last hemoglobin A1c was slightly elevated and we will 

check another one today.  I will have him follow up with Olga in 

PIMA regarding his diabetic control.
