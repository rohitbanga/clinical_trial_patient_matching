Tanner, Yul

MR #099-04-65-0

08/28/86

 

I saw Mr. Tanner today for a routine follow-up visit.  I last

saw him in November of 2085.  In May he presented to the

emergency room with dehydration and hyperglycemia.  Diagnosis of

non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was made.  He is now on

Glyburide and metformin.  His renal function at that time was

normal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.  His potassium at

that time was 4.6.  Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.  He has

lost about 40 lb.  He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary

counseling.  

 

Today his weight is 258 lb.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Heart rate

100.  Current medications lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,

hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,

metformin 500 mg t.i.d., diltiazem 180 p.o. q.d.   Urinalysis

shows 3+ blood, 4+ protein.

 

IMPRESSION:  #1)  Thin based membrane disease with persistent

hematuria and proteinuria.  #2)  History of renal ________.  

#3)  Type 2 diabetes.

 

PLAN:  Continue current medications.   Continue high water

intake.  Encourage weight loss and compliance with his diet.  

 

I spent some time talking to him about the importance of weight

loss and controlling his diabetes given his underlying kidney

disease.  Follow-up visit in nine months.

Record date: 2088-03-26

Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.



HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago. I had treated him with:

GLYBURIDE  5MG PO BID

METFORMIN  500MG PO TID

LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD

DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD

HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD



however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:



DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 



When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month. He feels well. He says he's lost 10 lbs. since his last visit (262 lbs. on 2/26 - 263 lbs. today) but he's interested in a weight loss program.



MEDICATIONS

DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 

GLYBURIDE 5 MG     PO QD  



ALLERGIES

NKDA  NONE  



SH: single, Ground Transit Operators Supervisor at HASBRO.



Habits: no cigarettes, drugs or alcohol;



ROS: denies weight change, fever, chills, fatigue, blurry vision, chest pains, palpitations, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel/bladder habits, joint pain, dizziness, exanthem, edema. No concerns about pain, functional status or nutritional status.



PE notable for:

Well nourished well appearing obese WM;

VITAL SIGNS

BLOOD PRESSURE  152/84

PULSE  68

WEIGHT  263

HEENT: sclera clear white OU, EOMI, ear canals and TMs wnl AU; oropharynx without lesions.

LN: No palpable neck or SC LN;

Cardiac: RRR, rate   68 , no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. by his account DM control is still poor, which is not surprising since he previously required 10 mg of glyburide and 1500 mg of metformin per day. For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.

2. also poor BP control for a diabetic. Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD. It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.

3. MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

4. discussed necessity for weight loss for DM, BP, lipids.

5. RTC 1 month.

Dear Dr. Truong:



We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.  As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.  Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.  He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.  The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.  Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.  Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.



On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.  His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.  His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.



His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.  A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.  A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.



We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.  We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.



Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.



Sincerely,







Rebecca Eason, MD
