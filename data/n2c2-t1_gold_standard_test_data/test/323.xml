IDENTIFICATION:  A 65-year-old woman presents as a new patient to discuss problems with leg swelling.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.  Longstanding insulin-dependent adult onset diabetes with a history of neuropathy and retinopathy.

2.  History of lower extremity edema with past evaluation per patient including a normal stress echocardiogram.

3.  History of low back pain due to degenerative disc disease.  The patient has been treated at the Bryan W Whitfield Memorial Hospital  with treatments including facet blocks and epidural injections.

4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

5.  Status post four vaginal deliveries, two cesarean sections and two miscarriages.

8.  Hypothyroidism.

9.  Former smoker approximately 15-pack-year history quit seven years ago.

10.  Hypertension.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a longstanding history of diabetes.  She has required retinal laser surgery for retinopathy.  She reports some tingling and numbness in the bottom of her feet.  She has had debilitating problems with lower extremity swelling over the last 18 months.  She notes that an extensive evaluation was initially done without a clear explanation.  Her endocrinologist had her stop her Actos which resulted in significant improvement.  Over the last six months, however, the patient has developed leg swelling again.  She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She does note some exertional shortness of breath, which she attributes to her weight.  She has no history of exertional chest pain.  She has not noted a change in her abdominal girth.  She has had no calf pain or swelling.  She does note a history of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.  The patient notes that she had a sleep study at some point in the past two or three years ago.  A CPAP device was recommended but not tolerated by the patient.  She notes that she has significant daily low back pain.  Her average pain is 8-9/10.  This occurs while she is standing or walking any distance.  She has very little or no pain when she is sitting or lying.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, unremarkable with no fever, chills, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, dysuria, skin rash.  The patient does have exertional leg cramps.  She notes a vascular evaluation was normal and her pain was felt due to her back.



MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 5 mg q.d., Bextra 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg q.d., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., atenolol 50 mg q.d., Flonase one spray each nostril q.d., quinine 324 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., aspirin 81 mg q.d., insulin, Humulin N 40 units b.i.d., Humalog sliding scale 15 to 25 units q.a.m. 15 to 25 units before dinner, levothyroxine 150 mcg q.a.m.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Weight 284 pounds, temperature 98.2, heart rate 68, blood pressure 140/64.  The patient is in no distress, breathing comfortably.  HEENT: Anicteric, no oral lesions.  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyroid mass or nodule.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation.  No wheeze, rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac: Regular.  Distant heart sounds.  No murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen: Obese, soft, no mass.  Normoactive bowel tones.  Extremities: 2+ edema to the knees.  Vascular: Carotid pulses are strong and symmetric without bruit.  Radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are strong and symmetric.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Edema.  The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.  She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.  I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.  She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.  Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.  I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.  Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.  The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.  I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.  I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.  I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.

2.  Low back pain. I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.  We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.  We elected against using these medications today.

3.  History of sleep apnea.  The patient has significant fatigue.  This may be due to her sleep apnea.  In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.  I discussed this with her today.  I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.  She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.  She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

Impression

My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W. She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother" coverage



Recommendation

My recommendations are:

1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO

2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO

3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

Xian, Brooklyn 
602-44-98-6


She was last in the clinic on October 24, 2063.  She comes in today with her husband and daughter.  (Her daughter is her legal healthcare proxy.)  They come in to follow up on a recent hospitalization at Mid Coast Hospital.  In January, she was noted by her family to be agitated and confused.  She was missing her medication or taking too much medication at times, including her insulin.  She also became paranoid when efforts were made to intervene to assist her.  Her family notes that this seemed to begin after her gabapentin dose was increased to 600 mg bid.  She was also taking some other drugs at the time that affect the central nervous system, including trazodone, benzodiazepines, and narcotics for back pain.  She was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry unit at Mid Coast in January 2065.  She stayed there for almost a week.  According to the family, some medications were discontinued and donepazil was started.  Also, they think she had a brain MRI.  She improved and was ultimately discharged.  She has done much better since discharge.  She went with family to Michigan.  They report that there she was much better, playing water volleyball last week.  Her husband is now supervising her medications.  He still notices some memory loss, but this has improved since her discharge.  She has had frequent headaches.  She has noted no urinary incontinence and no worsening of her gait.


According to available notes, drugs stopped during her hospitalization include gabapentin, trazodone, metformin, HCTZ, Hunulin, and Lispro.  She is back no the metformin and HCTZ.


Her current medications are: aspirin 81 mg daily, Celebrex, donepazil 5 mg daily, HCTZ, linsinopril, labetalol, Crestor, insulin, pramipexole 0.125 mg qhs, Protonix, Roxicet, L-thyroxine, temazepam qhs, and metformin.  She is allergic to erythromycin.


On examination today pulse is 60 and regular.  BP is 104/60.  She is alert and oriented to time, except the precise date.  She is aware that yesterday was Tuesday.  She is oriented to place.  Her mental and motor responses are slightly slow.  She displays an appropriate sense of humor.  She attends well.  She recites the months of the year promptly forwards and backwards. She registers 4 of 4 words.  She recalls 3/4 at one minutes and the 4th with a semantic clue with a slight error "14 Massachusetts Drive" rather than 24 Massachusetts Drive.  At 5 minutes, she recalls all 4 with only the error, "14 Massachusetts Drive" but with no need for a clue.  At 10 minutes, she recalls 2/4 without any clue, the 3rd with a semantic hint, and the 4th with a semantic hint again as "14 Massachusetts Drive."  She readily adds a simple sum in her head.  She follows multiple step commands.  She copies interlocking pentagons and a 3D cube well with only slight 3D perspective distortion.  She constructs a clock well with good planning and no neglect.  


Visual fields are full.  Pupils are 2.5 mm and reactive.  Fundi are not well visualized.  There rest of the cranial nerves are intact.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There are not extrapyramidal features, and there is no paratonia.  Reflexes are damp in the arms and absent at the ankles (UE 1/4, knees 2/4, ankles 0/4) and symmetric.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Romberg is negative.  She walks without hesitation in gait initiation.  Her stride is reasonably good,  Her base is only slightly widened.  She tandem walks with moderate unsteadiness.  


The examination has not changed much from her visit in October 2063.  She has some problems with memory by examination, but this seems to have improved greatly since her hospitalization.  Her confusion and reported paranoia seem to have gone away. Except or mild psychomotor slowing, she does not have features to suggest NPH as the cause, such as urinary incontinence or magnetic gait.  I suspect that her recent deterioration was due to adverse reaction to psychoactive medication that has now been discontinued of limited.


We will make no change in medication today.  We will request the recent MRI from Mid Coast.  She will return in several weeks after we have gotten the MRI.

02/12/2067


IDENTIFICATION:  A 71-year-old woman who presents to follow up diabetes.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I received the patient's recent blood work and asked her to come in for a short-term followup.  Her hemoglobin A1c is 11.1.  We discussed her current system for managing her blood sugar.  She notes 100% compliance in using her NPH insulin, 45 units in the morning, 40 in the evening.  She is taking 2 shots of Humalog, on average, in the morning and just before bedtime.  She is doing 2 fingersticks a day, in the morning fasting and before bed.  She notes recent indiscretions in terms of her calorie intake.  She checked her fingerstick this morning, but cannot remember the result.  She is fully compliant with her other medications.  She was on simvastatin in the past, which was stopped because of liver test elevations.  She was on Crestor in the past, which was stopped at the time of a hospitalization when her CK was noted to be elevated.  Today, she is having no fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, leg swelling, or leg numbness.

Allergies

AMITRIPTYLINE HCL - urinary retention
GABAPENTIN - memory loss


Vital Signs
BP 126/68 L Arm, P 69, Temp 98.0, Wt 235.0 lb




PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no distress.  Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154/71.  Repeating this after sitting was 126/68.  Lungs:  Clear.  Cardiac:  Regular.  Extremities:  Trace edema.



ASSESSMENT:  Uncontrolled adult onset diabetes.  Care for this will be challenging due to the patient's cognitive problems.  She does use Valley Hospital Web Services.  We discussed to start frequent communication via Web Services of test results will be helpful for me in helping her adjust insulin.  We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now.  We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense.  She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal.  I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal.  I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.  She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal.  She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.  I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start.  She will check a fasting fingerstick.  She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day.  She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal.  She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed.  She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time.  We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment.  Her last LDL was over 100.  I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin.  I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated.  Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable.  I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now.  Most of our visit today took place together with her husband.  We spent a total of 25 minutes with more than half the time spent in counseling.
