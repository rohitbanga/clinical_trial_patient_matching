Reason for Visit

Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.  We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.  He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.  He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.  Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.  He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.  His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.  I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.  He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.  He is worried about his remaining vision.  He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.  She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.  He also is having trouble sleeping.  He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.  He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.  He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

Source: Patient, pass-off, daughter-in-law



CC:  falls



HPI: Mr. Oshea is a pleasant 76-year-old male with a past medical history significant for DM, HTN, h/of CVA, and glaucoma who presents after increasing number of falls at home.  Pt lives with daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who were both recently sick and recovering from influenza.  The pt began to have a non-productive cough associated with a fever (101o-102o), watery eyes, diaphoresis, and chills early this week after his family was sick.  His daughter-in-law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period.  He has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual.  He has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months.  On average, he would fall about once a week.  On the day prior to admission, the pt walked to Procter Gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice.  He was helped back up by by-standers.  He describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently.  During each fall he denies LOC, denies CP, denies, SOB, denies incontinence, and denies head trauma.  On the day of presentation, the daughter-in-law reports that the pt fell 13 times and when she could no longer help him rise called EMS.



EW Vital signs:  T:98.6o, P:99, BP:174/65, RR:20, SaO2: 91% on RA

EKG (3/01/88): NSR at 84 bpm w/ RBBB, LAHB, q waves in V3-4, no ST segment changes



Radiology: 

CXR (2/27/88): No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT Brain (2/27/88): 

1.  Atherosclerotic disease, extensive microangiopathic changes and chronic appearing lacunar infarcts, as described.  No specific evidence of acute infarction, although DW-MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.

2.  No intracranial hemorrhage.

	          	          	          

Assessment: 76yo M w/ history of DM, HTN, and h/o of CVA presents with AMS and increasing falls in setting of influenza.  



PLAN:   

1.	Delirium:  Pt's waxing and waning mental status likely secondary from his underlying infectious processes - influenza and UTI.  

a.	Correct hyponatremia

b.	Monitor mental status as infection is treated

2.	Falls:  Pt's recent falls likely have a multifactorial etiology.  Pt has many risk factors for falls including visual impairment, mild cognitive impairment (on MMSE), possible diabetic neuropathy, and 

a.	Check orthostatic vital signs

b.	Check RPR/B12

c.	Pt needs PT evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate

3.	Hypovolemic Hyponatremia: Pt clinically appears hypovolemic.  A FeNa of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture.

a.	Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs

4.	UTI: Pt has positive U/A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).  Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI.  A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.  Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS.

a.	F/u UC

b.	Empiric treatment with Vancomycin 1g q12h for 7 days (CrCl > 60), await c&s for possible alternative agents

5.	Influenza A

a.	Continuous oxygen monitoring

b.	Supportive care

6.	Code Status: Discussed with patient, who expressed to me he would like to be DNR/DNI

7.	PPx

a.	Nexium

b.	Fragmin
