PATIENT NAME:  MEYER, OSCAR;    MRN:  2771447

Dictated on:  02/06/2095 by VICTOR M. ZUBIA, M.D.





Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE:



DATE OF CONSULTATION:



DIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.



HISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.  His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1.  Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.  He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency.  He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be.  The erections are still an important issue with him.  Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.  He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.  In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.  Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.  Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.  Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.

3.	Tonsillectomy.

4.	Right inguinal hernia repair.

5.	Inflammatory bowel disease.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.  He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.  He has no children.  He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.





PHYSICAL EXAM:

No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing

No gynecomastia

Respiration comfortable

No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs

No skeletal deformity or tenderness

Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 

Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.

No hernias.

Normal penis, scrotum, and testes.

Rectum: no mural lesion. Stool guaiac negative

Prostate is small.  The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.  I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference.  Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years.  His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.



On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation.  While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.  We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.  Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation.  Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.

Oncology COMPLETION NOTE 

Patient: Oscar Meyer  #277-14-47

RADIATION ONCOLOGIST: VICTOR M. ZUBIA, MD 

DATES OF RADIATION: 5/27/95 - 7/24/95 (58 elapsed days) 

DIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx,  Gleason 4+3 = 7,  PSA 7.1

CONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam. An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time.  Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease.  Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension.  CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.  He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment.

SPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT. Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound. 

SUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone. 

The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day. He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34. Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy/day for a total dose of 79 Gy. 

CLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil. Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.

FOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.

ID/CC: 64yoM with type II DM and HL p/w exertional SSCP, found to have lateral precordial/apical STDs


HPI:
Oscar Meyer is a 64yoM with type II DM and HL who has been having exertional, non-radiating, SSCP with activities such as shoveling snow and taking out the trash over the past several months, increasing in frequency.  He endorses 6 episodes over the last week, the most recent yesterday morning when he was shoveling.  The pain always resolves after 4-5 min of rest and deep breathing.  He denies n/v, palps, LH, and SOB but does have diaphoresis at times.  He presented to the SCH ED for evaluation today.


OSH course: The patient was hypertensive (max BP 200/89); he received Lopressor 5 mg IV x 2, resulting in BP 170/90; an additional 5-mg dose resulted in BP 160/87 (later, 146/79 just prior to transfer).  EKG showed small 0.5-1 mm STDs in V4-6.  Initial TnI was 1.00 (CK/MB wnl).  He received ASA 325, Nitropaste 1/2&#8221; (despite the fact that he takes Viagra at home), A heparin gtt was started (with bolus), and the patient was transferred to WPH in anticipation of cardiac cath.

CXR (SCH): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
     
Assessment:
64yoM with multiple cardiac risk factors p/w NSTEMI.

Ischemia: Plan for cath in a.m.  ASA, Lipitor, Lopressor, captopril, heparin gtt; tolerate up ACEI/B-blocker as tolerated.  Note that patient takes Viagra and therefore should ideally not have nitrates for CP, although he did tolerate Nitropaste at SCH; note that last dose of Viagra was Thursday, 11/29.  Serial EKGs and telemetry.  Will defer initiation of Integrilin until cath lab, as there is no clear benefit to starting now.  Need to check fasting lipids. 
Prolonged QTc: Etiology unclear, and no prior EKGs for comparison.  Will replete lytes for goal Mg=2, K=4. 
Pump: No ssx of CHF.  Will obtain post-cath TTE to assess for WMAs. 
DM: Holding orals while in house.  IVF with D5 while npo; cover FSBGs with RISS.  Will give Mucomyst and IVF for nephroprotection with cath. 
Ppx: Heparin.

    s/p cath


	Interval History:
   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:

64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes. 

He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1. 

He now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending. Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod. ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%. Plan is for med management.
