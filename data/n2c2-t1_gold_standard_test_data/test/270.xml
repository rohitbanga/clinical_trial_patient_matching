Notes


Reason for consult: Acute on chronic renal failure


HPI: 65 y/o man with PMH of stage IV CKD, HTN, CAD, RAS, DM, who was admitted to the CCU on 1/26 after an episode of bradycardia and PEA arrest at home.  Pt was found by his wife yesterday to be complaining of severe chest pain and SOB.  She called EMS.  Upon arrival of EMS, pt was in respiratory distress and bradycardic with a HR in the 20s.  He was intubated.  He subsequently became puloseless and asystolic and was coded for about 10 minutes with 3 rounds of epinephrine and atropine before he regained his pulse.  In the ED, his BP was 230/120 and he was started on a nitro gtt.  He was noted to have blood in his OG tube.  CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.  Chest CT showed multiple rib fractures with substernal hematoma and bilateral modest pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis vs consolidations.


On admission, pt&#8217;s BUN and creatinine were 43 and 4.35, respectively.  He was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis without a good response.  His Cr started to rise: 4.6 &#224; 4.9 &#224; 5.4 &#224; 5.33 &#224; 6.3 &#224; 7.0.  His urine output continued to be poor, and renal consult was called.

IMPRESSION: 65 y/o man with stage IV CKD, DM, HTN, CAD, s/p bradycardia and PEA arrest, now intubated with oligoanuric acute on chronic renal failure.  Etiology most likely 2/2 cardiac arrest with hypotension resulting in ischemic ATN.  Given his hyperkalemia and acidemia in the context of anuria, we will start the pt on CVVH today.  If his BP tolerates it, he may be able to transition over to intermittent HD soon.


1.       Will place right femoral vein hemodialysis catheter.
2.       Start citrate CVVH 120/2000 with DFL of 50cc/hr as BP tolerates
3.       I will examine his urinary sediment.
4.       Please check urine Na, urea nitrogen, total protein, creatinine.
5.       Please order renal US.
6.       Renally dose all medications for CVVH.

EDVISIT^29964344^WHITAKER, VINCENT^08/11/97^TRAN, FREDDY

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient and the resident, Dr. Nieto.  Please see her note for

full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old

gentleman with significant past medical history of hypertension;

diabetes; AFib; CHF; chronic renal insufficiency; end-stage renal

disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday; history

of PE and cardiac arrest as well as bacteremia who presents with

cough, weakness, chest pain, and palpitations.  At dialysis he

was found coughing and was sent here via ambulance.  He notes

decreased appetite.  He denies any fevers.  He has noted some

chills, some sweats, and some shortness of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is slow.  Temperature 95.9, pulse 89,

respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 180/71, and saturation is 95%

on 2 liters.  He looks dyspneic, dehydrated with neck that is

supple.  No rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.  Heart is regular

without a murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended. 

Skin is intact.  He has 2+ pedal edema.  He appears to be

lethargic but no focal neurologically.

LABORATORY DATA:  Review of his blood work shows a BUN of 31,

creatinine of 6.07, sodium of 139, potassium of 5.6 and

bicarbonate of 32.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is 63.  BNP is 501. 

Lactic acid is 3.  Troponin is 0.04.  White count 5, hematocrit

42, and INR 2.  Chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly, no acute

pneumonia.  An EKG with rate 106, normal ST-T changes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered empirically

with vancomycin, ceftazidime, given gentle IV fluid bolus and is

being admitted to Renal Medicine.  At this time, he is

hemodynamically stable.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Weakness, end-stage renal disease, and

possible early infection including bacteremia.

Imaging:

8/12/97 TTE: Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55-60% with beat-to-beatvariation. There are no regional wall motion abnormalities. Echocardiographic assessment is consistent with normal diastolic function. Nl RV, mild LAE, Mild RAE, mild to moderate MR with an eccentric laterally-directed jet, mild to moderate TR, w/estimated PASP 24.


A/P: 66M with MMP including HTN, CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD, AF, and h/o PEA arrest who presents for routine follow up after recent bleeding AVF admission and ED visits.


#. CV: BP well controlled today, but in the absence of his wife it is entirely unclear what medications he is taking.  We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem.  It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring.  I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now.
       - F/u with Dr. Vest
       - Follow INR
       - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife


#. Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3/30/97 unless changed over wire at HD.  He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump. His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).  


#. GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load/genotype have not been able to be determined.  It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past.  We will continue to follow HCV viral  load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology.  His synthetic function is mostly preserved.  #. DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen.  Last A1C was 6.0, and with recent evidence we will continue his current regimen.
  
#. OSA: Sleep study completed, qualifies for CPAP, and using with good effect.  


#. Other: Repeat utility letter
