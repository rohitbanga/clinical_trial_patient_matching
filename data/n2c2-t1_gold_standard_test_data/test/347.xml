                     Bailey EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

DARLING,BETTY   785-67-87-3

Resident history reviewed, the patient seen, interviewed, and 

examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, the history is as 

follows:  The patient is a 75-year-old white female with past 

medical history significant for throat cancer, status post 

radiation therapy; breast cancer, status post multiple 

lumpectomies; non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, 

hypothyroidism, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease with 

bilateral carotid stenosis - status post right carotid 

endarterectomy, who was seen earlier today at Faith Hospital 

after an episode of word finding difficulty associated with acute 

vision loss in her left eye while riding as a passenger in a car.  

The event was witnessed and reportedly there was severe word 

finding difficulty.  The patient was transferred to the Bailey Memorial Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation and 

management.  On arrival, she states her symptoms have largely 

resolved.  Evaluation at the outside facility included a head CT 

which reportedly revealed no events of acute hemorrhage.  Prior to 

transfer, she was treated with aspirin.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
including subacute weight loss. 

IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.  

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.  She
has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. 
Past right carotid endarterectomy.  

In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
pneumonia.  She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
artery and left common carotid artery.  She had subsequent
episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.  She is followed closely by
Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.  

During her most recent hospitalization she had some
confusion which was attributed to low sodium.  This was
felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
SIADH.  This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
Lasix.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  

Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
 Baseline weight 170 pounds.  Weight in early September, 167
pounds.  Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.  Weight <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 

28th</PHI>, 141 pounds.  Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.  

She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.  The
G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
 Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
swallow.  Her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has been
quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
foods here and there.  She is drinking two or three can of
booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
needs.  Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
(phone number 507.741.8042).  

Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.  

The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
her weight has decreased.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
blood per rectum within the last week.  The patient's
daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.  The
patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
visit. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. 
2. Throat cancer in early 2060s.  Status post XRT to the
neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
vertebral disease).
3. Breast cancer.  Details unknown.  Will review at next
visit. 
4. Diabetes, type II.  On glyburide.  Further details
unknown. 
5. SIADH.  Will review hospital chart in detail. 
6. Hypertension.  Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to
170.  
7. Hypothyroidism.  Details unknown.  Recent TSH normal.  
8. Glaucoma. 
9. Anxiety.  Being followed by Psychiatry on an active
basis.  This was apparently a large factor during her recent
hospitalizations.  
10. Possible recent anemia.  Has not been evaluated thus
far.  

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 10 mg p.o. Qa m and Qpm
4. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d.
6. Enteric-coated baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Sodium chloride 1 g p.o. Qa m via G-tube
8. Timolol 0.5%, one drop to the right eye q.d. 
9. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Normal saline 300 cc via G-tube after breakfast, lunch,
and dinner
11. Multivitamin p.o. q.d.
12. Coumadin, with goal INR 2.5 to 3.0 (followed by Internal Medicine)
13. Xalatan 0.005%, one drop each eye q.h.s.
14. Dulcolax 5 mg p.o. q.d. PRN, constipation
15. Risperdal 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN
16. Ambien 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN
17. Saliva substitute PRN
18. Nystatin, swish-and-swallow PRN
19. Fleet Enema PRN
20. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. PRN

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.  Her
daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.  Another daughter is staying with the
patient full-time.  Visiting nurse is involved.  Previous to
the last few months, the patient was fairly independent. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady
on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly
and carefully.  Has a cane, but does not always use it.  
VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),
and 171/74 on repeat.  Pulse 80.  Weight 146.5 pounds, fully
clothed.  
ABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender and
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  G-tube is
flushed with water, and flushes easily.  G-tube site itself
is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.  
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
1. Weight loss.  Probably due to poor caloric intake.  This
is a significant health concern for her, as she has become
progressively cachectic and weak.  This is probably
attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia. 
She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on
Tuesday.  I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate. 
She should continue to take p.o. foods as tolerated, but she
needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,
since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.  Will try Glucerna
because of her diabetes history.  The patient's daughter and
the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees
Nutrition Clinic in two days.  
2. Cerebrovascular disease.  Followed closely by Neurology. 
No acute change in neuro status today.  Will continue
Coumadin.  Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
this.  Recent INR 1.4.  Will adjust Coumadin as advised by
IM nurse.  
3. SIADH.  I need to review these records more closely, and
try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.  In
the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently. 
4. Diabetes.  Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300
to 350 range.  Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200
range over the past few days.  Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  Finger-sticks three to four times daily.  Further
adjustments PRN.  Our current goal is simply to maintain her
sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.  Once her
dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly
tighter control.  Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her
troubles with p.o. intake.    
5. Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.  Daughter
will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will
take it from there. 
6. Constipation.  Continue Colace.  Add Dulcolax PRN. 
Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.  If she does
have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and
her ability to eat successfully.  
7. Hypertension.  Currently in reasonable control.  Goal BP
140 to 170, systolic.  Initial severe hypertension this
visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue
for her.  Follow-up at next visit. 
8. Anxiety.  Followed by Psychiatry.  Extensive reassurance
given today to the patient.  She is very concerned about her
weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would
take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion. 

Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd

watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
9. Multiple other issues.  To be addressed at further
visits.  Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see
her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.
 Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
reevaluate Coumadin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.  Last
week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
 It was a very very windy day.  Afterwards she was outside and a
huge gust of wind knocked her over.  Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
the wind blew.  There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. 
She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
left eyebrow.  She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
lateral edge of her left eyebrow.  She had films of her wrist and
hips both of which were fine.  She has bruising in these areas. 
Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
back to normal.

She had marked hypertension up to 250.  She was treated with
hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
some hematuria.  Her blood pressure at home since then has been
180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.  She
is not on a beta-blocker currently.  She has not had any episodes
of chest pain.  She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., levothyroxine
100 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas. 
She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
weight 148 pounds.
GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
HEENT: PERRL.  Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
eyebrow is easily removed.  No evidence of any infection.  Her
left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
shoulder.  Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
bony step-offs.  She walks well with no pain in her left hip. 
There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
bursa.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
bruising but no more serious complications.  Fortunately she did
not have intracranial bleeding.  I am not sure why her blood
pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
falls verses independent causes.  Given that the high blood
pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
see how well this is working.  Goal BP 140-160 systolic.  Her
urine was checked today.  Hematuria has resolved.  She has 2+
proteinuria.  I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
her hypertension.

We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
and benefits of Coumadin therapy.  Although she is at risk for
falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. 
She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. 
I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
hemorrhage and its consequences.  I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
increased risk for falls.  It seems to me that she is in a gray
area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
for Coumadin for her.  She feels very strongly that she wishes to
continue.  This was discussed in detail with her and her
daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.  I
encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. 
More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
counseling and education.

Record date: 2098-06-13

Betty has been doing "okay" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability.  She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.  Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.



She is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.



She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.





Echocardiogram:

Date: 9/02/95: borderline LVH, preserved EF.  Posterobasal HK.  Not done for PFO.



Brain & Vessel Studies:

MRI/A:

CTA:

3/20/98: "severe proximal LICA stenosis", just distal to bifurcation...no comment on comparison.

9/29/95:  >90% RCCA, unchanged from the exam of 9/04/95.  >90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.  70-75% LICA.  The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.  Compared to the study of 9/04/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse. >50% in B ECAs.

9/26/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%.  Rbif without significant stenosis.  RVA dominant.

  	  	  	  	  	  	Ultrasound:

8/24/95: Low RCCA 50-75%, Mid LCCA 75-90%, calcified LICA possibly >50%

  	  	  	  	  	  	Angiography:

8/27/95: proximal RCCA stenosis >80%, ACA cross-filling from L-->R.  Right vertebral irregular/stenotic.  LCCA, bifurcation, LICA with significant tandem stenoses; at the proximal mid-LCCA, >80%.

  	  	

Functional Cerebrovascular Studies:

Diamox SPECT 7/14/97: interpreted as normal.

  	  	

Vascular Procedures:

Right CEA (years ago)

8/31/95: (1) right vertebral origin balloon angioplasty, successful.  (2) LCCA stent followed by balloon angioplasty.  (3) although wanted to stent LICA, exceeded fluoro time.

  	  	  	  	  	  	

Lipids:

Date: 11/96:  TC 183  TG 91  LDL 72  HDL 82,  Lipoprotein(a): , Homocysteine: 8.7



Hypercoagulable studies:

Date:  ESR:         Anticardiolipin IgG / IgM: negative 9/05



Blood Pressure:

12/15/97-3/5/98: 141-194/58-76  (with pulse between 56 and 70)

  	  	  	  	  	  	

Diabetes:

2/97: HbA1C 8.6

  	  	  	  	  	  	

Smoking:

none

  	  	  	

Other:

s/p XRT for throat cancer ~30 years ago

  	  	  	  	  	  	

Medications

COUMADIN (directed by Internal Medicine)

ASPIRIN 81

LISINOPRIL 40

ATENOLOL 12.5 (started 11/97)

ATORVASTATIN 10

METFORMIN 500 AM / 1000 PM

FUROSEMIDE 10 (started 12/97)

MULTIVITAMIN QD

XALATAN 1 DROP OU QPM

LEVOTHYROXINE 100MCG QD

AMBIEN prn sleep

SERTRALINE 50 QD

PREVACID 

  	  	  	  	  	



Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.

She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.  Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.



Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.  Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.  This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.  Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.  Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.  She is unable to tandem gait.



Impression:

Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.  She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.  Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.



My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.  I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.  I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.



I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.  I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.



I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.  Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.



I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.



This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.  While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.
