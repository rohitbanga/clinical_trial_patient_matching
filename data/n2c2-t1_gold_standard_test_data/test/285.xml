RE: Michael Ogrady

       MR #631-90-33-7

 

Dear Dr. Patton:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 

his coronary artery

disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.  As you know, this is a 

63-year-old male with a

long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 

peripheral vascular

disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 

diagnosed

esophageal carcinoma.  He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 

Landers, for the last nine

years.  Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 

artery disease which is

documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.  The 

catheterization demonstrated

right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 

and a 30%

marginal 1 lesion.  There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 

PDA and from the

septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.  The 

procedure was

performed through the right radial artery without complications.  Patient 

also has peripheral

vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 

vein bypass graft in

2088.  He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 

femoral to posterior

tibial graft.  He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.  His activity level is 

limited by his claudication. 

He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 

treatment.  

 

At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.  He gets 

chest pressure one to

two times a month.  However, his activity is extremely limited.  He reports 

that he has had a

positive stress test.  Further information is not available.  Patient 

understands he has coronary

disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.  On 

catheterization he had

preserved ejection fraction of 62%.  

 

He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 

after receiving

chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.  Patient states he will be 

receiving a Hickman

catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 

therapy. 

 

On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.  His blood 

pressure is 100/72,

heart rate is 57 bpm.  HEENT: oropharynx benign.  Neck: carotids intact 

bilaterally without

audible bruits.  Lungs: distant breath sounds.  Cor: without obvious jugular 

venous distention. 

Heart sounds distant.  Normal S1 and S2.  No appreciable murmurs.  Abdomen: 

unable to palpate

firm masses or aortic aneurysm.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities: status 

post surgery to the

left flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.  Distal pulses are absent.  Neuro: 

intact.

 

EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.  IMI with age undetermined.  

Nonspecific STT

wave abnormalities present.  No previous EKG for comparison.

 

Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 

artery disease and

peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.  He 

clearly has ischemia

on a positive stress test.  I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 

check ischemic

threshold.  He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 

event.  However, given

his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 

surgery even

understanding possible complications.

 

Plan:

1.   Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.

2.   Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 

control of

     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 

dobutamine

     echocardiography.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael 

Ogrady.  Please do

not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely yours, 

 

 

Susan Ximena Elias, M.D., M.M.S.C.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ogrady is a 66-year-old gentleman who is coming in to Grafton Clinic to establish care and to discuss several medical issues.

1.  Pain.  He has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time.  Has been treating with Percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average.  He was seen in the pain clinic and was started on Neurontin.  It is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen.  Dr. Hoover has been renewing his Percocet prescriptions.  He has had a CAT scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.

2.  Esophageal cancer status post resection by Dr. Patton.  He has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with Dr. Yan.  The last CT scan was in June 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup.  He has not yet had a repeat CT scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the Cancer Center where he feels more relaxed.

3.  Coronary artery disease.  He is status post an MI in 2084.  He has had several angiograms but no angioplasties by his report.  He is followed by Dr. Mckee at the Trimont Health Care Center.

4.  Status post fem-pop bypass of the left side.  He says he has been having increasing pain over the last several years on that side, which is why he takes the Percocet.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus with unclear control.  His last hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and that was in 10/94.  Status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, esophageal cancer status post resection, and history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.



MEDICATIONS:  Diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Percocet 5/325 six times per day, Dyazide 37.5/25 one time p.o. q.d., isosorbide 60 mg p.o. q.d., and Lopressor 125 mg  p.o. q.d.  



SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with his wife.  He is retired.  He used to smoke, quit in 2084.  Smoked for 20 years 2 packs per day.  No alcohol, no drugs.  



FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of cancer, unclear what type.  Father died of an MI and had diabetes mellitus.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Comprehensive review of systems was done and reveals that that he has chronic abdominal pain that is unchanged, occasional chest pain, and chest palpitations that has been evaluated by his cardiologist.  No fevers or chills.  No burning or pain with urination.  The rest of the review of systems was negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, his blood pressure is 122/80 and his pulse is 80.  His height is 6 feet and his weight is 230 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  He is well appearing.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Pupils equal, round, and react to light.  His extraocular are movements intact.  Oropharynx is without erythema or exudate.  Oral mucosa is moist.  Neck has no significant lymphadenopathy.  JVP is flat.  His thyroid is within normal bilaterally.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Good aeration, good air movement, no accessory muscle use.  Cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  He has a systolic murmur, which has been reported previously.  His abdominal exam is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a large central hernia.  He has several surgical scars.  His extremities, he has no edema, his DP pulses are 1+ bilaterally.  His reflexes are trace in the knees, toes are downgoing.  His skin exam, he has multiple nevi, some that are rather dark.  No specifically suspicious lesion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 66-year-old gentleman with multiple medical issues.

1.  Diabetes, recheck hemoglobin A1c today.  He is going to find out when the last time it was he had an eye exam.

2.  Pain.  He has had this pain syndrome for quite some time.  He is on short-acting narcotic and I think this is appropriate.  I am going to start him on a fentanyl patch 25 mcg p.o. q.d. and decrease his Percocet to 4 per day.  Hopefully, we will be able to wean him off his Percocet altogether.

3.  Esophageal cancer.  Follow up with Dr. Yan and Dr. Patton.

4.  Pulmonary nodule.  I emphasized the need for him to repeat his CT scan.  I sent an email to Dr. Yan.  He wants to only do them at the Cancer Center and that is where last films were done.  I explained how important it was.

4.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenia.  We are going to watch this.  He had a workup by Dr. Sawyer in the past.  He reports no bleeding.

5.  Coronary artery disease.  I asked him to get Dr. Landers's records for me, especially his last angiogram.  We are going to check his cholesterol today.  He will follow up with me in approximately 1 month's time to reevaluate his pain.

6.  His EKG today shows a sinus rhythm at the rate of 60, normal intervals, normal axis, and poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads and as indicated above, possible septal infarct and possible inferior infarct.  I do not have a baseline for comparison.4. 5.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pressure.

Mr. Ogrady is seen by the resident and also seen and examined by

me.  He is a transfer from an outside hospital to be admitted

because of his chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man who was

loading some luggage in a car this morning at about 4:30 a.m.  At

that time, he experienced acute onset of squeezing, chest pain,

and chest pressure associated with shortness of breath.  He

described his pain as being very intense about 9/10, described

heaviness across his chest and shortness of breath.  He stated

that while he was walking into his place his chest pain got worse

and since then it was intermittent and stuttering in nature.  He

was taken to Muncy Valley Hospital where he was seen, treated,

and transferred here.  He is currently pain free.  At Oakridge State his troponin was negative.  His CPK was

negative.  His EKG showed a Q-wave in III and aVF and had no

acute ST elevation or ST depression on his cardiogram which

correlates with our cardiogram here.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His history, however, is significant in

that he has a cardiac catheterization that was done in 06/2093. 

At that time, he had proximal LAD lesion of 30%, left main was

30%, and left circumflex was also 30%.  He had an RCA lesion

which was 100%, RCA proximal lesion, with good collateral flow. 

His last echocardiogram was in 03/2093.  At that time, his LV

function was normal and he had an EF of 55% to 60%.  His past

medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension as

well as high cholesterol, had an myocardial infarction in 2084,

history of metastatic esophageal cancer and history of DVT in his

left lower extremity in 2090.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has had an esophagectomy.  He

underwent fem-pop bypass surgery in 2088.  He has also had a

cholecystectomy and appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a 40-pack-year smoker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Also, has a strong family history of cardiac

disease.

MEDICATIONS:  He is now pain free but described his pain this

morning as squeezing, pressure like, and heaviness in his chest.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His vital signs here are normal.  His

HEENT exam is benign.  His neck is supple with clear lungs

bilaterally.  He has a 3/6 systolic murmur.  He has no rubs or

gallops.  His pulses are normal, well perfused throughout and

warm extremities.  Abdomen is soft without any masses, good bowel

sounds.  Extremities are normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG as described above again, a Q in III and

aVF, otherwise no acute changes on his cardiogram.  His CK is 33

and his troponin is negative.  His creatinine is 1.9 with a BUN

of 27.  All other labs are normal including his blood sugar which

is 156.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's cardiologist is Dr.

rule out and maybe even need another cardiac catheterization if

necessary.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain and chest pressure with history of an MI

and history of coronary artery disease.

EDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^03/16/98^OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS

I saw this patient with resident Dr. Elijah Parker.  Please see

his note for further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed

and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation

on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male

with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery

disease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,

status post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.  He was

discharged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.  He

had been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed

with a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was also given 1 g of

ceftriaxone.  His complaints prior to presentation had been chest

pain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and

palpitations.  On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem

and Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.  Other systems

were reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,

hemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.  Please see the chart.  He is currently

on aspirin and took today.

ALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic

appearing, and nontoxic.  Temperature 98, pulse of 111,

respirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations

are 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.  HEENT exam:  Mucosal

membranes are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. 

Lungs:  Crackles at the right lung.  Left lung is clear.  CVS: 

Tachycardic but regular.  Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse

tenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no

Murphy's.  He has normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and

dry.  Back is nontender at CVA points.  He has got bilateral

lower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and

calves.  Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented

without focal motor or sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2

bands.  Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated

with creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of

1.2 when he was discharged.  LFTs are all normal including lipase

and total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly

elevated.  First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.  EKG shows a

sinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave

changes.  Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have

been there in the past.  There is a hazy opacity in the right mid

hemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could

represent tumor versus pneumonia.  However, no significant change

prior to his discharge.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated

white count, this case was discussed with Oncology.  He was

admitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.  He is in stable

condition.
