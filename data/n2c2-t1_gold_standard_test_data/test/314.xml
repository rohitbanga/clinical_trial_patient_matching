Dear Dr. Trujillo:

 

Thank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady

with peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do

revascularization of the right leg.  Her history is well known to

you but I will repeat it for our records.  She has a long history

of cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30

years, stopping 15 years ago.  She has developed claudication,

particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her

husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved

by rest.  This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also

in the right thigh as well.  She had segmental leg pressures done

which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an

ankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.  An MR angiogram

showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this

as yet.

 

She has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes

mellitus, which she has had for 10 years.  Her other cardiac risk

factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of

myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her

cholesterol level is.  She has no history of hypertension,

although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the

past.  She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for

a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in

swallowing tablets and keeping them down.  She also has a past

history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma

that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive

therapy.  She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was

uneventful.

 

Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,

palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,

weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual

disturbances, and all other systems are negative.

 

She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin

only.  She has no allergies.

 

On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any

signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis.  Her heart rate was 85

beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms. 

The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid

upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible.  Her apex

beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second

heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops.  Her chest

was clear to percussion and auscultation.  She had no

hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.  She

had the scars from previous operations present.  Her femoral

pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side

without bruits.  She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and

posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on

the right leg.  There were no trophic changes in her legs.  She

had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf

level in a stocking distribution.

 

Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.

 

Assessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and

requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any

myocardial ischemia.  I therefore think a stress test is

required.  She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and

this will prove a problem for the long-term management of her

atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.

 

Plan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess

for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.  I have also

asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing

her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,

which is elevated.  I have also asked her to have a fasting blood

lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is

likely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.  I

plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after

her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.

 

I will let you know the results of her stress test when they

become available.  Thank you for allowing me to take part in this

lady's care.

 

Yours sincerely,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.  In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.  She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.  She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.  Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.

At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.  She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.  She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.  She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.  Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.  An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.  She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.

The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.  Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.

Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.  She denies dysuria.  The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.  At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.  Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.  Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.  Random fingerstick glucose is 202.  Extraocular movements are full.  The thyroid is not enlarged.  The neck veins are flat.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The breasts are free of masses.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops.  There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.  There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.  No other masses are palpable.  The lower extremities are free of edema.  I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  She has not been compliant with her medications.  She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.  She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.  She continues to consume three or four beers a day.  The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.  Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.  Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.  I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.  I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.  I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.  I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.  She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.  An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

History of Present Illness

Asked by Dr. Trujillo to comment on diabetes management for this patient. Hx from chart as pt is dutch speaking only. 



Mrs. Trent is a pleasant 69 y/o woman with type 2 DM insulin treated. She has acknowledged difficulty following her regimen, per notes should be taking insulin BID but only takes it in am - prescribed dose NPH 30 in am and 8 at HS. Reports BG at home near 150. 



She is s/p L SFA and doing well from that standopoint, however developed N&V today and required NG tube placement, now better but remaoins NPO. 



She has been on NPH 30 in am and BG's have been 126- low 200's.

Neurology Resident ED Consult Note



Patient Name:  Trent, Shirley

MRN:  99210914

Date:  12/08/94

PCP:   Dr. Rose Irvin-Ly



CC:  right sided weakness

HPI:  The patient is a 70 year-old right-handed Dutch-speaking female with history of DM, PVD presenting to ED with right-sided weakness which started yesterday morning.  The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain.  The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.  She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.  She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.  She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.  She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed.  She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.  She has had no facial weakness.  She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.  She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.  Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.  She has had SOB today. She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.



ROS:  

Gen:  No fevers/chills/sweats, CP, palpitations, N/V, URI, cough, abd pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR, rash, travel



Neurological:  Recent RLE pain as above.  No recent new changes in memory, vision, hearing.  No vertigo/dizziness, no bowel/bladder incontinence.  No swallowing or speech problems.  No h/o seizures.  Possible TIA in 2089 with transient left-sided weakness, CT head normal per PCP note.

IMAGING:

CT head without contrast 12/08/94:

Prelim:  Mulitple regions of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter bilaterally, and in bilateral capsulothalamic regions as well as the left caudate/periventricular region.



MRI/MRA head and neck:

Not yet completed.



Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:

The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are

	intact.  Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at

	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere.

	 

	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.

	 

	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.

	 

	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not

	associated with significant stenosis.

	 

	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum

	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the

	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen.  There is narrowing

	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of

	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as

	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence.



Old CT brain 6/16/89:

Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are

	not uncommon for a patient of this age.  There are no regions of

	hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction.  Basal

	ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar

	infarction.  No significant periventricular white matter changes are

	evident.



_______________________________________________________________

IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.  She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).  She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.  Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.  While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.  She had persistent nausea and vomiting.  



Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.  She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.  Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.  She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.  She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.  She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.  While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.  Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.





RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms

2.	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).

3.	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.  Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.

4.	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen

5.	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s

6.	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).

7.	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.



This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

Dear Dr. Pearson: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning. Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis. She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent. Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.

Interval History
Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago. She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair. She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties. Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy. According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year. Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96. 

Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months. A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma. This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent. She has felt "alone," but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters. Her other children have not maintained close contact.   

Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time. Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094. 

Past Medical History
type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin
h/o peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding 
hyperlipidemia 
peripheral arterial disease, bypass surgery on the right leg, mild symptoms of claudication on the left
left internal carotid artery stenosis

Medications (confirmed)
Baclofen 20 MG (10MG TABLET take 2) PO TID 
Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 
Gabapentin 100 MG (100MG CAPSULE take 1) PO QHS 
Metoclopramide HCL 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO AC 
Mirtazapine 30 MG (30MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS 
Multivitamin WITH FOLIC ACID (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD x 60 days
Novolog (INSULIN ASPART) SC QAM, QPM and SS 
Omeprazole 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD 
Toprol XL (METOPROLOL SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE) 100 MG (100MG TAB.SR 24H take 1) PO QD 

Allergies
NKA 

Social History
Mrs. Trent is originally from Suriname. She is widowed, with six living children. A son died at age 42 in August, 2095. Mrs. Trent has a remote history of smoking. She does not consume alcohol. She has recently spent much of her time watching television (like soap operas in Dutch) and participating in group activities (such as Bingo) at the home.  

Review of Systems
Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, visual changes, weakness, numbness, burning pain, paresthesias, difficulties speaking or understanding others, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain or burning on urination. Positive for frequent nighttime awakening. Appetite has been "o.k."

Exam
Blood Pressure 128/58     Heart Rate 76
Neck: no carotid bruits
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur
ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present
EXT: no edema
MS: alert, pleasant, cooperative, good eye contact. Fatigued, mildly depressed looking affect. Oriented to "LCC" in "Galena," "March 2095." Speech fluent in Dutch. Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand. Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail. 
CN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm. EOMI. Mild right UMN facial weakness. Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.
MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg. Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension). 5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg. 
SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left. 
DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left. Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Right plantar response extensor, left flexor.
CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger. 

MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 

CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.

CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel

Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.

Impression
Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094. Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque. She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now. Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression. 

Plan
1. We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
2. We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control. Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
3. Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy. Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl. I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time. 
4. I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep. After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.
5. Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.

It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you. Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.


Sincerely,
