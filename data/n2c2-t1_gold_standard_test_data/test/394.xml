Narrative History

   79 yo woman who presents for f/u of: 

   1.  Urinary incontinence:  She is s/p vaginal sling procedure by Dr. Xuereb in April.  She states that she did well for about 2 weeks, but then the incontinence became worse than before.  According to her son, she saw Dr. Xuereb 10 days ago who thought the procedure was a success but that the pt had a UTI.  She started her on a month-long course of nitrofurantoin.

   2.  PAF:  The pt has not noted any cardiac symptoms.

   3.  PMR:  Her shoulder pain and weakness has disappeared since starting the Prednisone.  She has noted some facial puffiness since the medication was begun.  She is being followed in Rheum by Dr. Lisa Inge.

   4.  Mental status:  She underwent neuropsychiatric testing at BMA 3 days ago and the results have been faxed to BH.  

   5.  Social:  She is currently living in Forest Hills, an assisted living facility.  She has her own bedroom and sitting room and can shut her door for privacy.  All meals are provided for her.  She enjoys the room but at times feels "confined."  She had befriended a 90 yo male patient, but recently had a bad experience when he made sexual advances toward her.  She states that she would like to move back into her apartment in Stow.

   4.  Depression:  Much better.  No physical signs/sx of depression right now.  Continue Remeron.

   5.  Dementia:  It was suggested in the neuropsych evaluation that a cognitive enhancing medication may benefit the pt.  Will discuss starting Aricept with pt's cardiologist, Dr. Jankowski, to make sure it will not impact her Afib.

   6.  Hyperlipidemia:  Lipitor was d/c'd at some point over past year.  Will check chol/HDL today since she is not fasting.

   7.  Social:  Discussed results of neuropsych evaluation with patient.  Discussed issues of living alone and how she would need 24 hour supervision.  Pt not sure if this situation would be better than assisted living.  Discussed these issues with pt's son, Villatoro, over the phone after the visit.  Will fax him paperwork for health care proxy.

Narrative History	

81 year old woman who presents for an annual exam with her daughter-in-law, Franchesca Justice.  They would like to discuss the following issues:

1.  Shoulder pain:  She continues to have bilateral shoulder pain, but the L shoulder is worse than the right.  She has been taking Prednisone 9 mg a day for a long time but has not f/u with Rheum for about a year.  She did have a cortisone in the L shoulder in the past.  She is able to lift her arms over her head.

2.  Depression:  Her family feels that she is doing much better on the Effexor than the Celexa.  The pt has seen Dr. Ramsey in Psych a few months ago.  

3.  Dementia:  Dr. Ramsey recommended continuing on the Aricept.  Overall, the pt's family feels that her memory is worsening, although some days are better than others.  She has not had any other episodes of halluncination, as was described in an email from her son a couple weeks ago.  The pt states that she is sleeping and eating well, but her family thinks that she sleeps too much.

4.  Eyelid surgery:  She is scheduled to have surgery on her eyelids on May 25.  The drooping of the lids is so bad by the end of the day that she is unable to read.

5.  Incontinence:  She has now had 3 collagen implants for her bladder.  The pt does not think that she is any better, but when Dr. Xuereb tested her a few months ago, she saw some improvement.

6.  Diarrhea:  She has about 2 soft BM's a day, but she also has intermittent diarrhea.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if the pt might be lactose intolerant.  She is not having any blood in her stool.  She does not have any diarrhea in the middle of the night.  She has never gotten a colonoscopy since the last attempt just prior to her hospitalization 2 years ago.

7.  DM:  The pt states that she does not eat much sugar, but her daughter-in-law thinks that she probably does consume a fair number of sweets.

8.  Hyperlipidemia: She has been on Zocor 20 mg QD but is not following a low fat diet.

9.  Medication compliance:  The pt's family is not sure if she is taking her medications every day.  They pay a private nurse to come lay out the meds in the am, but the pt is often asleep when she comes and will not get up to take the meds at that time.

10.  Onychomycosis:  The pt has a fungal infection in her great toes.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if there is anything topical to treat this with.  The pt gets regular pedicures.

Social History	

Lives in Forest Hills, an assisted living facility; never smoking; Etoh- rare- she might have one drink if she goes to her son's house for dinner; exercise- walking.



Family History	

Family History: mother died at 89 of "old age"; father died of unknown causes; no breast or colon ca; brother is s/p MI before age 60; + DM.



Review of Systems	

No change in weight, appetite.  No dizziness, F/C/N/V, cough, SOB, CP, abd pain, constipation, dysuria, joint pain.



Physical Exam	

BP: 122/70		Weight:	132 lbs. (down 8 lbs) 	Height: 5'2"

GENERAL: 	Elderly woman with Cushingoid facies.

SKIN:		NL turgor, no abnormal lesions.

HEENT:	            NL eyes, lids drooping over eyes about 1/2 way; NL oropharynx

NECK:	            No thyromegally, no nodes; carotids 2+ bilat without bruits.

CHEST:	            Clear lungs, NL frame

COR:		NL S1S2, no murmur, rubs, or gallops.

BACK:	            No spinal tenderness.

EXT:		No edema, clubbing, or cyanosis; DP pulses 2+ bilat

NEURO:	            NL MS, NL gait



Assessment and Plan	

1.  PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.  We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.  Will check ESR today.  Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.

2.  Depression:  She seems better.  Continue Effexor. 

3.  Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.  Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.  Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.

4.  Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.  Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.

5.  Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.  Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.

6.  Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.  Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.

7.  DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.

8.  Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.

9.  Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.

10.  Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.  Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.

11.  Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

HPI:  83yo female with a h/o dementia, HTN, DM, Afib, PMR, and chronic diarrhea sent from her assisted living facility for altered mental status and suspected UTI.  Per the patient's son, the staff at her facility has noted the patient to be more confused over the last 3 days.  She has had more frequent episodes of fecal incontinence with soiling of her bed and carpet. Some blood was also noted in her toilet. Her son also reports that she has been less awake than usual and has had some congestion and coughing.  She has had no fevers, chills, chest pain, sob, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. A urinalysis was reportedly positive at her assisted living facility and the patient was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. 



At baseline, the patient is generally quite confused.  She knows her name and often location but not the date/year and talks frequently of her late husband and parents whom she believes are still alive. Her assisted living facility has recently suggested that she be transferred to their higher level of care program.

Dig level 0.3



Blood cx 1/29/95 x2 NGTD

urine cx 1/29/95 NG



CXR 1/29/95: minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis



EKG: aflutter with variable block, no ischemic changes



A/P:  83 yo female with dementia, HTN, DM, AF, and PMR with worsening mental status over several days. Per report, her urinalysis was positive at her living facility, however there is no evidence of urinary or other infection now (now WBC or fever; CXR neg, Ucx/Blcx NG). Suspect her altered mental status is secondary to progressive dementia and dehydration. The patient was also noted to have blood in her stool at home and a 10 point Hct drop in the emergency department. While the patient did get 3L of fluid in between which could cause dilutional anemia, given the patient's history of blood in stool and guaiac positivity, will work-up possible GI bleed. 



1.	Decreased Hct- GIB v. dilutional.  Does have h/o diverticulitis.

a.	Serial Hcts q8

b.	2 large bore IVs at all times

c.	Consider GI consult if Hct continues to drop for possible EGD/colonoscopy (although pt has had multiple unsuccessful colonoscopy attempts in past)

d.	Nexium 40mg po qd

2.	AMS- likely progressive dementia in setting of dehydration. 

a.	F/u urine and blood cultures

b.	Hold antibiotics as no clear source of infection

c.	Check TSH, B12, folate, LFTs, lytes

d.	Hydrated in ED

e.	Check head CT

f.	Attempt to wean effexor; consult geri-psych per attending

3.	Rhythm- has h/o afib and SVT, now in aflutter with variable block. HR goes up with activity and when due for meds.

a.	Cont lopressor, sotalol, digoxin

b.	Hold aspirin for possible GIB

c.	Telemetry monitoring

4.	Hyperlipidemia- statin recently increased

a.	Check fasting lipids

b.	LFTs

5.	Diabetes- glyburide recently increased. Will hold for now in case needs to be NPO.

a.	RISS coverage

b.	Check HbA1c

6.	PMR- Cont Prednisone 5mg po qd; would like to try to taper if possible

7.	FEN- appears euvolemic now. Diabetic diet.

8.	Prophy- no fragmin/heparin. Pneumoboots. Nexium.

9.	Dispo- consult physical therapy

10.	Code- FULL CODE, discussion with son
