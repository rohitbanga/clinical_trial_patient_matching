A/P: 



1. Cerumenosis- the right canal was flushed completely clear after a 10 min soak with Colace soln, Pt's hearing was restored, trace cerumen on the right and Pt was instructed to use H202 soak and then flush at home on a monthly basis to prevent recurrence



2. Poorly Controlled HTN- likely exacerbated by ear discomfort and hasn't taken am meds yet; review of flowsheet shows diatolic was 100 at June visit to Dr Hayes.
