PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient was evaluated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the 
history is as follows:  This patient is a 54-year-old black male 
with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who presents 
with acute, severe substernal chest pain.  This pain began 
approximately five hours prior to presentation, but accelerated 
within the previous one to two hours.  It is accompanied by 
diaphoresis, but not by shortness of breath or nausea.  The patient 
does have a history of prior CVAs, but no history of previously 
documented cardiac disease. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is in 
acute, severe distress.  He is diaphoretic and somewhat pale.  The 
vital signs are as recorded in the Nurses' Notes but are stable 
initially.  The HEENT examination shows the sclerae to be 
anicteric.  The oropharynx is somewhat dry.  The neck is supple, 
without venous distention.  The breath sounds are clear 
bilaterally.  The heart shows a regular rate and rhythm with 
somewhat distant tones, without discrete murmur.  The abdomen is 
slightly obese and soft throughout, without tenderness.  The 
extremities show no discoloration or edema. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrocardiogram shows an acute 
anterior myocardial infarction.  Other laboratory studies are 
pending at this time.  A chest x-ray has been obtained, though it 
has not been processed at the time of this dictation. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with 
aspirin and nitroglycerin en route.  He was started on a 
nitroglycerin drip, which was incrementally increased to 80 
micrograms per minute.  He was given morphine sulfate in 2 mg 
increments to a total of 10 mg.  He was given 5000 units of 
intravenous heparin.  He was given 2.5 mg of intravenous Lopressor. 
The Cardiology Service is here with the patient and he is being 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for immediate 
angioplasty. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Myocardial infarction. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above. 
Please see the handwritten record for further details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

1.  He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.  These are 
improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
ranging from 150 to 190.  He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.  He has not had any 
further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
seems to be sticking more to the diet.  He has however gained some 
weight, which is a little disconcerting.  He does attend a podiatrist 
and is doing well from that perspective.  He is to return to the 
ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.  He 
missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
follow-up with nutrition at this time.
2.  Cardiovascular.  He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.  Further question regarding his stroke back 
in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
to have a hole in his heart at that time.  He was eventually stopped off 
Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
put on Coumadin for life at that point.  He had an aborted myocardial 
infarction in 2067.  He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
yards before getting very short of breath.  He has no orthopnea or PND.  
He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
3.  Health maintenance.  We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.  He 
has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
checked on the day prior to the test.  This will be scheduled by our 
secretary.  He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
standard dose and titrate up slowly.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.  He is tachycardic 
at 98 beats per minute.  Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
sided cataract.  Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.  The 
abdominal examination is also normal.  His injection sites were clean 
and without erythema.  There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
his feet appeared well.

We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.

PLAN:
1.  Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
2.  I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
left the other doses as is.
3.  I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
4.  We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
5.  I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
above for colorectal cancer screening.
6.  Return to see in a week's time, understands.  He can discuss any 
management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.
