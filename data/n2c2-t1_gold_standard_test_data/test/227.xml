Patient Name: LE, WILLIAM;  MRN: 0540099
Dictated on: 08/09/2161 by WILSON RUCKER, M.D. 

 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presents for evaluation of chronic neck and left arm pain.  
 
HPI:  This is a 71-year-old right-handed gentleman with past medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease, status post bypass surgery, hypertension, and bladder cancer, who presents with worsening neck and left arm pain, which is now interfering with his daily life.  The patient has had a chronic arthritic pain throughout his body, which he has been complaining of for approximately 10 years involving his 
neck, shoulder, arms, knees, and back.  More recently in the past months to couple of years, his neck, left arm, and shoulder pain have been his predominant pain symptoms.  It has been a gradual onset.  He has had similar problems in the past.  He reports that his pain is intermittent and occurs daily.  He states the pain is burning, cramping, pins and needle, sharp, numb, shooting pain, dull achy, electric- like, throbbing, and pressure-like.  The pain involves numbness to his hands and fingers on his left arm.  His pain ranges from 10/10 at worst to 0/10 at best.  It is worse in almost all active positions including lying down, standing, sitting, walking, and driving.  Medications do not seem to help.  Relaxation and rest decreases the pain.  It is also worsened by lifting or bending his neck.  He tried physical therapy approximately 10 days ago at Manamana with minimal to no relief.  The patient has had injections to his cervical spine in the past, he has had shoulder injections, which helped in the past.  He had MRI performed of his 
cervical spine on March 21, 2161, which documented moderate- to-severe degenerative changes throughout his cervical spine with significant right neuroforaminal narrowing at multiple levels.  There is narrowing of the left neural foramen at 
C5-6.  
 
PAST MEDICATIONS:  The patient is not clear what pain medicines he has taken in the past.  
 
Current medications include Nexium, Colace, atenolol, aspirin, Neurontin 200 mg two times a day, insulin, Pravachol, glucosamine chondroitin, vitamin E, Lasix, and potassium chloride.  
 
He has allergies to penicillin, Vioxx, and Lipitor.   
Past medical history is significant for high blood pressure, heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, 
hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and bladder cancer.  
 
SURGICAL HISTORY:  He denies any spine surgery.  He has had two prior arthroscopic knee surgeries.  He had twice left shoulder surgery; he is not clear what this was.  He has had a TURP.  
 
PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY:  He has high school eduction.  He is not currently engaged in regular exercise program.  His pain does limit his daily activities, especially bending over and also affects his recreational activities including regular yard work and lifting.  He also has lifting restrictions from orthopedic physician as well as yard work restrictions from his cardiac physician.  He is a retired wholesale specialist.  He worked for over 30 years in sales 
business.  He is not currently working.  He is married and lives in Dickinson, Maryland.  He denies any history of alcoholism, detox program or current tobacco use.  He denies any history of psychologic evaluation or treatments including _____ and no history of abuse.   
He has family history heart disease and diabetes.  
 
Review of systems is negative for any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chills, recent infections, bleeding, positive bowel or bladder incontinence, numbness in the genital area.  He does report some numbness and tingling in his arms as well as legs as reported above and some generalized weakness of his muscles, particularly with his left upper extremity muscles throughout.  He denies any problems with sleep.   
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman appearing his stated age, slight obese, well nourished, well groomed.  Psychiatric:  Normal attention and concentration, normal mood and affect.  Eyes:  Conjunctivae anicteric, no ptosis.  Skin:  No rashes or lesions.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  No intercostal retractions 
or accessory muscle use.  Musculoskeletal:  Spine 
inspection, no significant kyphoscoliosis.  Cervical range of motion is limited throughout.  Flexion 20 degrees, extension 10 degrees, rotation is 20 degrees, right and left.  The patient is unable to side bend significantly. Reflexes are 2+, bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis. Manual muscle testing is 5/5, bilateral upper extremities 
with the exception of wrist extension, shoulder abduction, and shoulder flexion and extension, and internal, external rotation.  Muscle tone is normal with the exception of asymmetry in the left hand interossei.  Sensory testing is impaired to pinprick, throughout bilateral upper extremities to the elbows.  Intact grossly to light touch per the patient's report.  Gait is steady with a cane.  The patient has signs of limited range of motion in the left shoulder, status post multiple surgeries and limited range of motion in all directions.  He has some palpation tenderness of the cervical spine, in C5-6 and C4-5 paravertebral areas on the left.   
Medical decision making involved review of the patient's radiology reports and radiology films.  
 
IMPRESSION:  The patient has a significant degenerative disease of his cervical spine.  In addition, he has multiple levels of neural foraminal narrowing and herniation in the cervical spine.  In addition to this, he has symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with also prior traumatic injury to his shoulder with possible brachial plexopathy.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1.  Given the multiple etiologies possible for his symptoms in his left arm, which are his predominant symptoms:  Brachial plexopathy versus peripheral neuropathy versus cervical radiculopathy, we have referred the patient for an EMG to delineate the cause of his symptoms.  
2.  He will return to clinic after his EMG and from that point, we will decide the course of action for pain management.  At this time, he will continue on the Neurontin 200 mg two times a day.  We will review his medications on next visit.  We provided the patient also with education in regards to his problems and the treatment options.

RE:  William Le

MRN:  054-00-99

DOB:  09/03/2089



DOS:  02/25/2163



Dear Dr Chavez,



Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.  He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home. He has not sustained any significant injuries.  He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.



Medications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.



Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.  He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.  Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.  Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet. Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.



Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.  This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162. This most likely is a MGUS.



Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.  The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.  Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.  He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.  I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control. Follow-up in 6 months





Sincerely,







Charles Tisdale

			Reason for visit:

   Follow up of CAD s/p CABG adn multiple CV risk factors



			Interval History:

   A 74 yo man with a long history of CAD eventually necessitating CABG in 4/2161.  He has had several chest pain syndromes over the years but, as of late, has been doing quite well in that regard.

His last CV evaluation was an Adenosine PET in 4/63 which showed an EF 46 with anterior and anterolateral flow abnormalites.  These are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).  His last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his OM and to his RCA and a patent but atretic LIMA.  He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).  

He was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.  His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.  He does have a long-standing trifasicular block.

He denies any chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LEE, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.

Someone started him on Niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.





			Past medical history:

   CAD with CABG in 4/61, LIMA to LAD, V to RCA PLVB, V to OM  -- he has an unbypassed occluded Diagonal with collaterals from the OM

			Assessment and plan:

   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.  His chest pain syndromes have resolved.  He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.  This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.

CV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.

Plan.

1. CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.  He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).

2. LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.

3. DM-followed by Dr. Orton.  Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0

4. Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.  Continue to Rx risk factors.

5. Lipids-look great today.  Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon!  We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.

6. HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg.  I am trying to get him on an ARB again.  Diovan at 80 a day. He will get f/u labs in one month
