                           OFFICE NOTE
 
Chandler, Jessica
MRN #748-80-38-0
May 05, 2069
 
Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.  Since the surgery she has done
quite well.  She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
and also education on dietary modification.  During her hospital
course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  She was
started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.  She
also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24. 
She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit. 
Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
diuretics.  
 
Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.  She is
not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
of breath.  She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
 
Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o. q.d.,
lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o. daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o. q.d.,
Kayexalate 15 p.o. q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o. q. day, Nephrocaps
one tablet p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o. q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o. q. day and
CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.  
 
Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
pounds.   Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
150/100, pulse is 80.  Her skin is without any rashes or
ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.  Heart regular rhythm,
distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.  Her lungs are clear,
there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
healed.  Her extremities are without any edema.  
 
Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.  
 
Diagnosis:
 
1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica

3)   Diabetes mellitus.
 
4)   Anemia of chronic disease.    
 
5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  
 
6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.  
 
7)   Hypertension.
 
8)   Morbid obesity.
 
Plan:
 
1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.  She is clinically
     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
     or angina.  Her ejection fraction significantly improved
     postoperatively.  I am concerned about a relatively high blood
     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.  I will
     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
     of her potassium.  
 
2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.  Again we'll check regular labs
     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.  
 
3)   Diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Her blood pressure have been
     under fairly good control.  She has also lost a significant
     amount of weight over 20 pounds.  Her current weight is 326
     pounds.  We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
 
4)   Anemia of chronic disease.  We'll also recheck her blood count
     and follow-up.
 
5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient is using her CPAP
     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
 
6)   Hyperkalemia.  She will continue with the Kayexalate as
     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
 
7)   Morbid obesity.  She is making good progress with her weight
     loss.  She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
evaluated by Dr. Wooten.  Please see Dr. Wooten's note.  The 
patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
sputum.  She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting. 
Minimal diaphoresis.  She has had a fever.  No urinary symptoms. 
She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery 
bypass grafting. 
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, 
albuterol and Nephrocaps.

Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.  I had added
Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.  However,
her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
increase in her BUN and creatinine.  Her BUN is in the 80's, and
her creatinine is about 3.4.  She states her breathing has been
excellent, however.  She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
exertion.  She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
having any kind of dry cough.  
 
Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
q.day, Paxil 20 p.o. q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o. q.day, Prilosec 20 mg
p.o. q. day, Atenolol 50 p.o. q.day, Lasix 120 p.o. b.i.d.,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o. q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.day.
 
Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
 
Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
acute distress.  Her weight is 330 pounds.  This is down over 20
pounds over the past month.  Her blood pressure is 122/80.  Her
pulse is 80.  Her lungs are clear.  Her heart reveals distant heart
sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.  Her extremities are notable
for the absence of lower extremity edema.  Her abdomen is also
noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
past.  Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.  There is beefy red
granulation tissue surrounding this.  
 
Diagnosis:
     1.   Congestive heart failure.  
     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.
     3.   Morbid obesity.
     4.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.
     6.   Foot ulcer.
     7.   Depression.
     8.   Health maintenance.

Plan:
     1.   Congestive heart failure.  She is doing much better on
higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
since her last visit here about a month ago.  At this point in
time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
telephone conversation in four days.  Should she have an increase
in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.  Stable
without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.  Continue current
medication. 
     3.   Morbid obesity.  She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.  I strongly wanted her to go
on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.  She is
planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.  I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.  
     4.   Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Continue current
regimen.  
     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.  The plan as above is to
stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days. 
     6.   Diabetic foot ulcer.  I also gave her a duoderm dressing
to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her
podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about
appropriate treatment.
