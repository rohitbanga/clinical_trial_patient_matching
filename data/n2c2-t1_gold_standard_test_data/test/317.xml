Dear Hicks,


I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.  She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.  As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.  She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.  Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.  She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.  Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.  It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.  She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.  You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.


Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.  She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.


She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.  She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.  She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.


In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.  Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.  She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.  She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.


Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.


Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.


She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.


She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.  She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.


As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.


On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.  In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.  She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.  She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.  Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.  Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  Her abdomen is benign.  She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.  Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.  Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.  In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.


An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.  There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.  There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.


In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.  She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.  However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.  Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.  However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.


During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.  I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.


We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.  If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.  I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.  As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.  This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.


It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.  We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.


Sincerely,

CC: Bleeding from groin wound
HPI: Ms. Hendricks is a 52yoF with a history of PVD and non-healing wounds of the LLE s/p redo left femoral-tibial bypass with arm vein on 5/3/78 who was discharged to home yesterday and now returns after she noted a gush of blood from her left groin wound while coughing earlier today.  She was doing well until this morning when she coughed and immediately noted that her left pant leg was soaked with blood from the left groin down the left leg.  When she took off her pants there was no active bleeding from the wound and she denies any light-headedness or dizziness.  There has been no further bleeding from the wound and she is otherwise without complaints.

Assessment/Plan: 
- 52yoF s/p recent redo left fem-tib bypass with right arm vein with single episode of bleeding from left groin wound.  This likely represents extrusion of a postoperative hematoma.  There is currently no evidence of active bleeding from the wound.  A CBC should be obtained in the ED to ensure that her hct is stable and she can then d/c home.  She will follow up with Dr. Ishikawa at her scheduled postop visit.  Should the bleeding persist or return she should return to the ER or the clinic for a vascular U/S to assess for a pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. 


D/W Dr. Casey Iacono (Surgery Fellow), who agrees with assessment and plan.

Dear Dr. Schmidt:

Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.  As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.  She has done well since the procedure.  She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  


On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.  She is alert and oriented x3.  She appears grossly neurologically intact.  Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.  Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.  It remains superficial.  She has no other ischemic skin changes noted. 


I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.  She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.  She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.  I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.  She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.  She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen. 


If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD

In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.  The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.



- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin

- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan

- NPO from midnight, pepcid

- check chem7, CBC, coags

- has an insulin pump

- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic

vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial

bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity

cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.  She was recently treated

at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,

had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex. 

She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48

hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.  She has

also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not

had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or

other symptomatology.  She has also not noticed any urinary

symptoms of frequency.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and

fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in

2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies

tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,

respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on

room air.  General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no

apparent distress.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  The

abdomen is soft.  The patient does have insulin pump in place,

but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.  Skin is warm,

dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,

which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the

right lower extremity.  This erythema stops at the ankle and does

not extend up above the knee.  The patient also has an open

chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot

as well.  There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:

 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased

sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated

by me and the resident.  I confirm that I have seen and evaluated

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the

patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient as well as the resident.

The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.  CBC showed white

count of 14 with shift.  LFTs were within normal limits.  X-ray

of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray

of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.  Given the

erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this

vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of

vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed

outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting

her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.  The patient's

erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be

extremely atypical for a DVT.  We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is

followed closely by Surgery and this notification was

made at 8:30 p.m.

Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point

we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she

does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she

needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on

maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the

hospital.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.
