Dictated at: 01/25/72 by HOLLAND KELLER, M.D. 

 
 
 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  
Dr. Hayden Avery 
 
REFERRAL SOURCE:  
Above.  
 
CONSULTATION REPLY 
 
Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.  I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.  
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.   
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.  He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.  If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.  This is relieved by sitting.  It will happen when walking as well.  This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.  He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.  Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.   
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s. and Selexa.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.  
 
BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.  
 
EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.  He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.  He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.  He has no HIV risk factors.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.  He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.  He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.  When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.  There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.  Pulse of 60 and regular.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Mental status:  Unremarkable.  Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.  No evidence of retinopathy.  
 
Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.  Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.  Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.  Rapid alternating movements intact.   
Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.  Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.  
 
The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.  Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.  Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.  He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.  He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.  
 
DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).  Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.  The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.  
 
ASSESSMENT:  
1.  Neuropathy.  The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.  He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.  He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.  There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.  I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.  I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.  He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.  I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.  
 
Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.  
 
The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.  
 
DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

RE: Otis Narvaez

        MR   #04561326

 

Dear Dr. Huynh:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 

consultation.  As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 

of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.  Recently, he underwent 

evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 

dobutamine stress echocardiography.  The echocardiogram revealed reduced 

left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.  

There was no evidence of ischemia.  He subsequently underwent coronary 

catheterization.  I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 

told that he had no arterial blockages.  Symptomatically, he is 

significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.  He has attributed 

this to his weight.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 

although he has not been taking either of these medications.  Prior to 

his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 

upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.  This was confirmed 

subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 

lung malignancy.  He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 

you.

 

His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 

back pain, and obesity.

 

Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 

q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.  No drug allergies

 

Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.

 

Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.  He smoked for 

40 years but quit approximately three years ago.  He drinks rarely, 

although drank heavily in the past.

 

RE: Otis Narvaez

       MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 

                       

December 30,  2072                                         

 

Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.  He denies 

gastrointestinal complaints.

 

On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 

140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.  HEENT is unremarkable, neck 

supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 

without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 

regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 

murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 

CVA tenderness.  No clubbing cyanosis or edema.  Pulses full.

 

Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 

function by echocardiogram.  By report he has no evidence of coronary 

artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.  If indeed 

it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 

this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 

his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.  In any case, this 

puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 

than if he had significant coronary disease.  I see no reason why you 

should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.  Prior 

to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  

I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 

to South Side Hospital.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

 

 

Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.

RE:  Otis Narvaez
     MR #045-61-32-6

Dear Uddin:

Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.  His previous visit with me occurred on
February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.  He
denied chest pain, but did admit to a "tight" feeling down his left arm on occasion.  This was not
associated with activity.  He admits to being a very sedentary person.  

The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
LV function, and CT coronary angiography.  There were no significant findings on the clinical
evaluation.  The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. 
The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
limiting stenosis.  There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. 
There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.  The
narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.  

A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
342 mg/dl.  He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.  

He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.

Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.  He
denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.  

His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily,

aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.  He usually takes these once every other day.  He is
now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.  He takes this at bedtime.

Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.  This causes him
to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.

He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.  He also has chronic low
back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.  He also has
degenerative joint disease in his knees.  He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
depression.  

He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.

On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
cell carcinoma.  

On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.  His
weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
reveals upper dentures in place.  There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. 
There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.  On cardiac examination, the heart
sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
distal right calf.  There is no edema noted.

I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.  He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
Kraft will perform the procedure.  His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
catheterization.  After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
comprehensive metabolic profile performed.  He will return to see me in the office again in one
month.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,


Kenneth Z. Sellers, M.D.
