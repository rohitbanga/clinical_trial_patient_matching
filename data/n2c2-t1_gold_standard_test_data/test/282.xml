RE:  Peter Joshi

     MR #453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.  Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint

of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.  The patient does relate that

he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly

worse several years ago.  However, with the treatment of his

coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until

he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.  Since that

surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time

during which he has required supplemental oxygen.  At the same

time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure

and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing

Lasix.  The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he

did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician

did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.  At the current time,

Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is

able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several

months ago.  In fact, he was told recently that he does not need

supplemental oxygen.  He denies a chronic cough, although he does

occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to

coughing.

 

His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery

stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent

placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,

hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and

upper GI bleed.

     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70

 

His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,

Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,

potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.

 

He has no known drug allergies.  He discontinued cigarette

smoking years ago.

 

On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.  His pulse was

56, afebrile.  O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when

I rechecked it, it was 95%.  His weight was 221 lbs.  He is in no

respiratory distress at rest.  His oropharynx had dry mucosa and

a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.  His neck had no

enlarged lymph nodes.  Chest had diminished breath sounds in the

left base with crackles.  His right lung was clear.  His heart

was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic

murmur.  His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.  His

extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.  Pulmonary

function testing had been performed in December and was repeated

again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined

restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.  His current

vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of

December.  He has no bronchodilator response.  I took Mr. Joshi

for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that

includes after walking up one flight of stairs.

 

In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely

mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning. 

However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on

my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred

him to have a decubitus chest film taken.  Mr. Joshi had several

questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have

recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.  I do

not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled

corticosteroid for this gentleman.  I do recommend that he get

daily exercise.  He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and

I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that

he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.  I have also

confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen. 

His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced

defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for

albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely

to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary

vascular disease.  However, we will certainly reassess this after

his initial work-up.  Thank you for referring this interesting

patient.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

call.

 

 

 

Sincerely,

RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.  This lovely gentleman continues to see

both me and Dr. Orlena Knowles.  I have discussed this with Dr.

Knowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all

would need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care.  He notes that

his weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed

closely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium

chloride doses.  He has had no shortness of breath at rest.  He

has noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema. 

He has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  His

medical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO

b.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,

Lopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5

mg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d. in

addition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.

 

His physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right

and left arm seated.  After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right

and left arm seated.  His heart rate is 70 and regular. 

Respiratory rate is 10.  His room air saturation is 95%.  His

lungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are

somewhat distant.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for

nondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.  His

abdomen is soft and nontender.  Extremities are notable for edema

to his knees bilaterally.

 

RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4            -2-              June 06, 2070 

 

Electrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14

and normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.  No

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing

congestive heart failure.  His pulmonary evaluation here was

notable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive

pulmonary dysfunction.  I would certainly concur with continued

diuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and

creatinine.

 

If there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.

 

Sincerely,

Re:  Peter Joshi

MR #45339844

 

Dear Dr. Hodges:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Hospital Regional Universitario.  This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and 

congestive heart

failure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid 

endarterectomy and cardiac

procedure.  At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally 

active because of the

flooding.  He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.  He has had no exertional 

neck, chest, arm

or jaw pain.  He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of 

activity and he does

have mild lower extremity edema.

 

His medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, 

simvastatin, Norvasc,

Prevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.  

 

On physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds.  His blood pressure is 

124/60 right and left

arm seated.  His heart rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  

There is a mild increase in

jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are actually 

clear to auscultation

throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur 

but no gallop is

present.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  

Extremities are

notable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the 

posterior tibialis and mild

pitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.  

 

His electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  

No significant

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the 

present time.  He reports

that he has had renal insufficiency in the past.  Before adjusting his 

Demadex dosing, I will

reassess his kidney profile.

Dear Dr. Craft,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.  This lovely gentleman with coronary artery

disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction

notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,

who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.  Despite this

intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,

palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present

time.  He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg

p.o. t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,

simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid,

multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.

 

On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.  His heart

rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  There is no

increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without

bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. 

Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and

physiologically split S2.  His abdomen is soft and nontender.  He

has no bruits.  His extremities are warm with strong symmetric

pulses and motor strength throughout.  He has no peripheral edema

at the present time.  His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus

bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,

and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior

electrocardiograms.

 

Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a

concerning blood pressure.  At this point, he notes that he is

actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue

to do that.  We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will

be following up with you within the next few weeks.  If there are

any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me

a call.

 

Sincerely,

 

Dictated By: Corrine James-Wagner
