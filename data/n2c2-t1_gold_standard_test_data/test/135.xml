Intern Transfer Note

Mitchell, Katie 

MR# 6146161

Date of Admission: July 24, 2091

Date of Transfer: Jul 28, 2091

Pulm:  Geoffrey Lucas

PCP:  Evelyn Conway (Raymond)

Cards:  Janssen



ID/CC: SOB



HPI:   Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ a PMH notable for COPD w/ FEV1/FVC=63%, HOCM s/p MVR and septal myomectomy in 2085 who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past 4 days.  Of note, her and her son note increasing DOE for the past 4 months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today.  She also reports DOE and productive cough with green- yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on 7/10/91.  She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with 6 loose BMs.  On the day prior to admission, she had drenching sweats but didn't take her temperature.  She has also had decreased po intake (though improved w/ treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia) but denies F/C/CP/abd pain/dysuria.  Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called..	

	EMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance.  In the ED, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.  She initially required bipap with O2 sats of 93%.  She was given prednisone, Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.  Of note, she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the 120s.  She received ASA, Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK-MB but negative troponin at 0.03.  Her EKG improved with rate control w/ IV Lopressor.  She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out 200cc urine.  She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB.



ROS:   No F/C, + NS.  Improving appetite. No CP/Palpitations/Orthopnea/PND/Claudication, + LE edema for the past 1-2 months.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No slurring of speech, unilateral weakness. No dysuria.



Hospital Course: Patient had TTE performed on 7/24/91 which showed increase trans-mitral valve gradient. Given patient's history of MVR, TEE was recommended. On the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head. No change in MS. In the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds. On 7/25/91, patient went down for a TEE but desated to 80s and the procedure was aborted. Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday 7/28/91. On 7/26/91, decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night, and the patient did well and felt rested the next morning. On 7/27/91, because patient looked so well, she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on O2NC for the night. This AM, patient's respiratory status declined satting in the low 90s while on O2 6LNC. ABG was performed which showed 7.48/52/50. After speaking to cardiology, decision was made to transfer the patient to the CCU for intubation prior to cardiac cath this PM. A TEE will be performed while patient is intubated. Patient is currently NPO ready for cath this PM.

___________________________________________

Impression:

Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ multiple medical problems including HOCM, s/p MVR and myomectomy as well as COPD who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past four days.  Of note, the patient notes increasing DOE for the past 4 months but with acute decompensation today.  Her progressive DOE may be related to CHF, especially in the setting of ischemic changes seen on EKG however, her acute decompensation may be related to COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness.



Plan: 

SOB- Unclear etiology currently by may likely be multifactorial

--Treat COPD w/ Atrovent nebs, prednisone, O2, Levaquin

--Patient did not tolerate tachycardiac so Albuterol was DC'ed

--Follow urine output secondary to IV Lasix

--Daily weights, strict Is and Os

--Keep O2 sats 88-90% 

EKG changes- Pt w/o known history of CAD however w/ and ST depressions on EKG that appear rate related

--IV Lopressor to decrease rate

--ASA

--Cardiac monitor

--Cardiac cath per Dr. Janssen with TEE

MVR- On Coumadin

--Follow INR

Trigeminal neuralgia- Improving w/ pain control and Tegretol

--Continue current management

FEN- 

--Encourage Pos

--Replete lytes as needed

6.    Prophylaxis- Nexium, Coumadin

EKG: ? sinus, abnormal P-waves morphology 



Impr/Plan:  75 yo woman with MVR, HOCM, severe AS who p/w following episode of syncope.



1. Syncope: hx worrisome for cardiac etiology given suddenness of the episode w/o much warning.  Likely etiologies could be some decreased pre-load in setting of recent increased diuresis, perhaps decreased po intake in a woman dependent on preload 2/2 her valvular disease.   In addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.

--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, LV function, could consider stress test

--will consult EP to assess pacer function

--pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight

--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent 

--will re-check carotid studies

--will re-start ASA (it was recently stopped) given carotid and vascular disease



2. CHF: pt carries diagnosis of CHF and CXR c/w some pulmonary congestion.  On exam, pt with crackles bilaterally also c/w pulm edema.

--will cont outpt lasix but need to be very careful given pt's tenous volume status



3. COPD: cont outpt regimen



4. FEN: normal diet, replete lytes as needed



5. proph: boots, TEDS since pt HIT positive, nexium

CARDIOLOGY

PORT HURON HOSPITAL



Reason for visit:

   77 year old woman with mitral stenosis, S/P redoMVR for thrombosed St. Jude valve, now with porcine MVR, AS, COPD, S/P R total hip replacement.



Interval History:

   Mrs. Mitchell has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypertension and COPD.  She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.  She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.

			

Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range. 



Since her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.



She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.

INTERPRETATION:



FEV1 and FEV1/FVC are reduced, FVC is normal. TLC is normal. FRC is normal.

RV is increased.  RV/TLC ratio is increased. Resistance is increased;

specific conductance is decreased. Single breath diffusion capacity is

severely reduced, although there was only one adequate maneuver performed and

thus reproducibility cannot be assured. DL/VA is reduced. These data

demonstrate a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit. The spirometry obtained

today are similar to those from 12/14/2092. Resting room air oxygen

saturation is below normal limits, and there is significant arterial oxygen

desaturation with exertion.

Assessment and plan:

   77 year old woman S/P redo-MVR, AS, CHF, COPD, S/P R hip replacement.



Problems:



Congestive heart failure -  Her LV outflow tract obstruction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is well compensated with metoprolol and verapamil SR. She cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of her severe aortic stenosis. Continue diuresis with bumex 6 mg po bid. Good BUN and Cr, weight close to target, overall euvolemic.





Chronic obstructive lung disease -  Followed by Dr. Lucas. PFT's stable.
