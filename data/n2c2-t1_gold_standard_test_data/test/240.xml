History of present illness

			

  Oneill was hospitalized at the Muscatine Health Center shortly after leaving the YCH following his catheterization and placement of the stent by Dr.  Hall.  Because of the recurrent chest pain at Muscatine Health he was catheterized again from the left groin and the stent seemed to be functioning normally.  He was given the usual supportive therapy and discharged.  He is now taking Isordil 30 mg SR daily as isosorbide mononitrate.  He takes metoprolol 25 mg one-half BID, Procardia XL 30 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg per day, K-Dur 20 mEq daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg daily, Advair 25/50 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg per day, terazosin 10 mg per day, and atorvastatin 10 mg HS.  He states that he feels completely well.  He has noted good healing in the left groin.  No new issues.

  I believe he will do well.  We will be starting his diuretic again now.  No more chest pain.  Followup will be with Dr.  Hall on schedule.  He will call if new symptoms develop.  Followup urinalysis and culture are planned.  Unable to pass his urine today, but will get one when possible and he will pass it here so that we can get a urinalysis as well.

	Reason for visit:

   chest pain



	Interval History:

   Cardiologist:  Hall



Mr. Innis is a 77 y/o man with h/o CAD s/p LAD stenting (Taxus Express 3.0x16mm) in 3/95.  All other vessels had only minimal irregularities.  Since that time, he has had only mild chest discomfort which is always relieved with nitroglycerin.  



This morning, he had a more severe episode of chest pain accompanied by SOB and diaphoresis that started when walking to the dock after starting his boat.  The pain was primarily in his back, similar to his angina prior to stenting.  The pain lasted for approximately 30 min despite SL NTG, although did go away eventually.  He had diaphoresis, SOB, and blurred vision associated with the pain.  He was brought to the ED by his family.  On arrival, he was pain free. P 60 BP 110/70.  He was treated with ASA and Lopressor.  EKG was unremarkable.  Two sets of markers were negative.  He is admitted to complete rule out MI and further diagnostic testing.



He currently denies pain and feels back to his baseline.  He denies orthopnea, PND, LE swelling, + occasional palpitations, no syncope/near syncope.

	Reason for visit:
   s/p proximal Lad stent today


	Interval History:
   Mr Innis is a 77 y.o male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and CAD. His cardiac history dates back to March 2095 when he experienced dyspnea and exertional chest pressure that radiated to his jaw and arms. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed LAD disease and he underwent PTCA/Taxus stent to his LAD. 

He did well until August 2096 when he presented with a dull mid scapular discomfort that radiated to his upper chest. These symptoms were accompanied by diaphoresis, dyspnea and transient blurry vision. After evaluation and clearance by Neurology he underwent another cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed his LAD stent was patent but he had a 90% lesion proximal to the stent. He had PTCA/Vision stent to his LAD. 

Since 11/19/2096 he has had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with relief of his dyspnea. He continues with daily exertional chest discomfort that resolves with rest and sl nitroglycerin. 

Today he presented for elective cardiac catheterization which show ed a proximal 90% occlusion and mild In stent restenosis. He had a cypher stent placed in his LAD. He arrived in Cardiology pain free and hemodynamically stable.
