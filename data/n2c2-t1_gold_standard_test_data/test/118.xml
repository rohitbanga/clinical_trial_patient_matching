CC:   syncope, AS

HPI:  
54 y/o Columbian speaking male with HTN, HL who was in Columbia and had syncopal episode 2 days ago after climbing 4 flights of stairs. There are conflicting stories of his prodrome   some notes mention that his syncope was precipitated by chest pain, however he denies this and only reports some dyspnea and fatigue as he was climbing the stairs.  He believes he was unconscious for a few minutes. On waking up, he reported some nausea and vomiting.  He was taken to a hospital in Columbia where he had EKG changes and CK was 308 and troponin was 0.19.  Echo at the OSH in Columbia was showed AS with peak AV gradient 62, mean 38. Valve size was not commented upon. He was offered surgery however he elected to come back to America and now presents to the ER.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
54 y/o Spanish speaking male with HTN, HL presents to PNC after syncopal episode 2 days ago and was found to have AS at OSH.  Mean gradient of 38mmHg indicates moderate disease.  Prognosis after syncopal episode due to AS is 3 years.

AS:  Monitor for syncope, CHF, ischemia
Repeat Echo to assess valve area, gradients
Afterload reduction--start on ACE
Cont statin, check lipid panel
Avoid nitrates, diuretics
His symptomatic AS warrants w/u for AVR
Ischemia: EKG changes c/w LVH although doesn   t quite LVH meet criteria. Did have + enzymes at OSH, although denies hx of chest pain. Positive biomarkers ? due to coronary insufficiency in the setting of AS.
Cont ASA, lipitor
Cycle enzymes
Will likely need coronary angiography before AVR

HPI: 
Patient is a 54 y.o. male with h/o aortic valve replacement, CHF, and HTN who presented to PNC as a transfer from Montebello Convalescent Hospital with a diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to Montebello Convalescent with a history of RUQ pain that began on July 3rd. He was found to have choledochal stones and underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy on July 07. Subsequent to this he developed a bout of generalized abdominal pain two days later and he was noted to have a marked and new increase in his amylase and lipase levels (3191 and 2171, respectively), diagnosed as acute post ERCP pancreatitis and transferred to PNC for further management.
Dr Gregory Xing explained to him via an interpreter and with images of his CT scan that he has gallstones and pancreatic pseudocysts that have persisted as compared to his last CT in July 2117.
The procedure of open cholecystectomy with Roux en Y drainage of pancreatic psudocyst was explained to him and he was consented. 


He will be an inpatient 3 days prior to surgery for transition from Coumadin to heparin / lovenox therapy.
He is presently doing well, with no fevers or abd pain. He is eating well and has returned to his normal life.

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	PARK NICOLLET CLINIC
	


	Reason for visit:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up. 


	Interval History:
   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.  He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.  He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.  At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.  He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.  He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.  His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay. 

Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.  He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.  He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.  He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.  A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.  The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.  On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.  A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.  Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.  An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.  HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.

His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.  He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim. He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.  With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.  His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA. He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.

Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well. He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.  He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.  He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.  The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.  He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.


	Past medical history:
   1. MRSA/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03/13/2117. Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18. Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure.
2. RV failure. Complication of aortic homograft surgery. TEE on 2/20/18 showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR.
3. HIT. Developed HIT post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2/18.
4. Coronary artery disease. Preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03/11/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main; proximal 30% lesion in the LAD; 50% lesion in D1; mid 50% lesion in the left circumflex, and normal RCA. 
5. Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT.
6. Hypertension. 
7. Hyperlipidemia.

	Assessment and plan:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis. The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.  At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF. HE has evidence of severe TR on exam. From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.  His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection. 

PLAN:
1. PVE endocarditis.  He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement. He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID. We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today. He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.  We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.
2. RV failure.  Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.  We will continue his current dose of lasix.  Dry weight ~175-178 lbs. I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity.  We anticipate some recovery of RV function.  
3. ARF. Resolved. We will check a follow up chem panel today.
4. Right foot gangrene. Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection.  ABI testing in 3/18 showed no PAD.  He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery.
5. CAD. Non-obstructive disease.  Continue ASA, atenolol and lipitor.  We will hold on ACE-inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues.
6. Hyperkalemia.  Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.  Ww will check follow up chem panel today.  He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.   

Patient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up. Patient seen with Dr. Calhoun.
