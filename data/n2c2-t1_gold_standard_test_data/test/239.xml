Chief Complaint

Dyspnea and exertional chest discomfort 



History of Present Illness

Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.

Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE. Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.  He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.   He refused further work-up or intervention until recently. He presents now for cath and surgery.

Record date: 2067-08-02

60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.  It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.  He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.  He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.

In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.  Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.  He was discharged without clear follow-up.

The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.  He has been ambulating on the wound.  He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.  He reports no pain.

Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.

Physical exam: In no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 100/58.  Weight is 236.  Pulse is 70 and regular.HEENT: Pupils equal round reactive to light.  Extraocular motions intact.  Oropharynx moist without erythema or exudate.  Neck: Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy, or thyromegaly.  Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi or rhales.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Extremities: Right lower extremity with a 1.6 cm x 1.6 cm black eschar to be great toe.  Lesion is soft.  It is unclear if there is significant tracking beneath the surface.  A 3 cm x 2 cm flat based ulcer with surrounding callus formation is noted to be ball of the right foot with some granulation and no drainage.  A collar is noted.  No surrounding erythema is appreciated.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable but clearly diminished.

Assessment and plan: This is a 60 year old gentleman with multiple medical issues including end-stage renal disease my for regurgitation, congestive heart failure, severe peripheral neuropathy, diabetes.  Present in with two large altars to the right lower extremity.  He is status post hospitalization and some debridement and appears to have had little overall improvement in clinical status.  I will proceed with an aggressive outpatient treatment plan however I suspect that he will need inpatient admission once again if significant improvement is not rapidly obtained.  A referral has been made to the Island Medical Center wound clinic for this Tuesday.  Visiting nurse has been arranged for his home for wound care in the interim.  He is advised to avoid all weight-bearing and to keep his foot dressed at all times.  I have explained to the patient that he is at risk of amputation of at least his right great toe should his healing not improve.

With regards to his other medical issues, he continues on dialysis.  I have asked for a hemoglobin A1c and fasting cholesterol to be drawn at the time of his dialysis tomorrow.  I'll see the patient on Tuesday.  

His blood pressure is appropriately controlled and he is no stigmata of congestive heart failure

At today's visit, the patient's wound was dressed and cleaned the our nursing staff

ROS
As detailed. He also has been c/o dizziness and weakness after dialysis, which was the main reason he refused to go for HD yesterday. No additional hx is available, no known sick contact per wife. When he was in ED, he was noted to have LGF 100.4, hypertensive and tachycardic. He is waiting for head CT and possible LP.

NAD, limited cooperation with exam, A+O x2
CV: tachy/reg, no rubs
CHEST: CTA ant

Neuro: nonfocal-limited exam

DATAEKG is not available for review, but no acute ischemic changes and no widened QRS/peaked T wave per ED.
PCXR: poor penetration, but no acute process
Head CT       IMPRESSION:

1. No hemorrhage, mass lesion, or evidence of acute territorial
infarction.

2. Extensive nonspecific periventricular, deep, and subcortical
white matter changes are likely sequela from chronic
microangiopathic disease.

3. Old lacunar infarctions in the left caudate head and right
caudate-anterior corona radiata.
Evaluation for acute ischemia is limited in the areas of extensive
white matter disease. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging
is more sensitive in assessing for acute ischemia and should be
obtained as clinically indicated.

HPI: Asked to see patient by surgical team in consultation for is multiple medical issues. I have served as his PCP for eight years. Pt seen and examined. Case discussed in detail . This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia. Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA. He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up. At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance. At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.


The patient's wound has currently not been closed. He has a vac dressing in place. He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology. Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening, self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea. This resolved spontaneously. He has also been intermittently refusing his medications and has been attempting to ambulate.


This AM.  the patient actually denies ever experiencing chest pain. He also only recalls his foot pain with repeated prompting. He denies any pain, dyspnea

EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.


Assessment/Plan
 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes. Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.


By issue:


1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.


Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.  If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.


2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well.  Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.


3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future. 
4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today . Recs per nephrology
3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
 Thanks,
