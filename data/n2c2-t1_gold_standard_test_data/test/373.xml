Mr. Jimenez developed fevers, drenching night sweats, and a 15 pound weight loss in September of 2080.  He was admitted to LCH on 10/11/80 at which point a fever workup was negative but CT scans revealed bulky lymphadenopaty in his neck and abdomen as well as splenomegaly.

COMPARISON: 12/22/86          FINDINGS:     Lines/tubes:  None.          Lungs and pleura:  There is continued right mid and lower chest     opacity consistent with loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis.     This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous     study. There is no  pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  There may be a small     posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle     suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with     mild CHF.          Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are     unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and     tortuous.          Bones:  The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study.          IMPRESSION:     Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving     predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax.  The appearance     of this has improved slightly since the prior exam.  No new focal     consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study.          There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild     CHF.     Plan:
1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP.
2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy.
4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. 
5. HTN: BP poorly controlled. For admission anti-hypertensives. Monitor.
6. Psych: he appears depressed. Likely reactive to current poor health. I will alert PCP.
7. Code: FULL
8. Family: Daughter present and aware of plan

HPI: Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20.  Patient himself is without complaint and denies any fevers, chills, SOB, CP, cough, edema, PND, increasing abd girth, orthopnea, palpitations.  However, per medical record it appears that patient was sent from rehab day PTA for concern of left upper ext swelling.  Was felt to be asymptomatic and sent back to rehab.  Today was sent to LCH given concern for his left upper extremity as well as bilateral low extremity swelling and wt gain with concern for possible CHF flare.


Of note, on day of d/c from LCH, patient had negative LUE U/S for DVT.


ED course:  In the ED, patient was found to be afebrile with temp 98.2, HR 64, BP 160/61, RR 16, &amp; O2 sat of 99% RA.  CXR remarkable for loculated right pneumothorax &amp; interval increase in airspace density suggesting worsening pleural effusion v PNA.  His WBC was nl @ 4.8 with slight left shift 75% PMNs.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20 &amp; increasing pleural effusion.  Increasing wt gain could be secondary to low ext edema. ?right heart failure 2/2 to pulm htn or perhaps diastolic dysfunction; however BNP not very elevated.  Patient&#8217;s albumin is only slightly below 3.4 as well.  Low suspicion for DVTs given exam with bilateral low ext swelling &amp; recent negative LUE noninvasive.


1.      Low ext edema/wt gain: Patient responding well to IV lasix from ED.
a.     Trial of daily PO lasix
b.     Strict I/O/s, daily wt
c.     Consider a repeat TTE, but recently performed 5 months ago so expect little change.
2.      Loculated pleural effusion:  With effusion enlarging, question if patient would be candidate for decortication/pleurodesis.
a.     Consider thoracic surgery consult
3.      ID: Will hold on further antibiotics at this time.  Afebrile without elev WBC.  Suspect CXR showing increasing pleural effusion.  Low suspicion for PNA.
4.      CV:
a.     Rhythm: Rate control with digoxin, labetalol.  Hold coumadin for elevated INR.  Restart when &lt;3.3.
b.     HTN: Cont Norvasc, labetalol, hydralazin, lisinopril
c.     PVD: Cont statin, ASA
5.      T2DM: Cont NPH 6 units BID + RISS


F/E/N:  No conc sweets.


PROPHYLAXIS:
GI: Not indicated.                
DVT: Coumadin
BOWEL: OBR
