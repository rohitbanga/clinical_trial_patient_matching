CCU Admission Note
Patient is transferred from Florida Hospital Orland

Otto Qazi
MR# 527-62-21
Date of Admission: January 12, 2083
Admitting JAR: Hunter Hayden, MD
Attending:  Quinten Prado, MD

Reason for Transfer: STEMI

HPI:   
58yoM with h/o CAD, HTN, smoking; presents to FHO with chest pain and found to have lateral STEMI.  He experienced mild central chest pain on the night prior to admission while working outdoors, pain resolved after about an hour and he attributed it to GERD.  However, he awoke at 5:30 AM on the morning of presentation with recurrence of chest pain, 6/10 severity, lasted for about 15-30 minutes and then resolved with Maalox.  Pain recurred about 9:30, of similar severity, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, non radiating, non-pleuritic.  He again took zantac and Maalox without improvement.  After 15 minutes he walked to the local hospital ER and during walk the pain increased in severity to 8/10.  He describes the pain as similar to his previous MI.

Upon arrival to FHO found to have ST elevations antero-lateral.  Given lopressor, heparin, integrillin, morphine, ASA, and medivac to WCH arranged for cath.  He states that by the time he was in transit, his chest pain had resolved.  He arrived at WCH, was taken directly to cath lab, found to have a proximal LAD lesion with cypher stent placed.  He remained chest pain free following the procedure and was sent to the CCU in stable condition.

At baseline he states he can walk    a couple    of miles without rest, he rarely takes stairs on a daily basis.  He smokes profusely and has little interest in quitting.  He feels he has had no occurrence of chest pain since last one.  However, he does report that his plavix was stopped recently, and he has difficulty affording all his medications.

Sinus at 80bpm, Left axis, normal intervals, 1-2mm ST elevations/hyperacute TW V2-V3, 1mm STelevation I/aVL, 1mm ST depression/TWI II/III/aVF.

Admission to CCU s/p cath:
Resolution of ST elevations I/aVL, persistent TWI aVL, Qwaves V2-V3, 1mm STE V2-V3, TW height has improved; ST depressions inferior leads have resolved.

___________________________________________
Impression:
58yoM with risk factors including CAD, HTN, HL, presents with evidence of antero-lateral infarction by EKG and history transferred from OSH for cath and PCI.  He is stable post-cath, with resolving EKG changes; had cypher stent to proximal LAD felt to be the culprit lesion due to the EKG changes.  He continues to be chest pain free post-cath.

Plan: 
Ischemia:
BB, ASA 325mg, plavix, lipitor 80mg daily.
Continue integrillin for 12 hours
Follow markers, daily EKG
Lipids, HbA1c
Cardiac rehab, smoking cessation consult, nutrition counseling
Rhythm: Currently sinus rhythm
lopressor
Monitoring in CCU for arrhythmia
Pump:  No h/o CHF
 Given anterior infarct, will obtain TTE
Prophy:
Nexium, when off integrillin consider add lovenox prophylactically
Dispo:  To SDU when stable x 24h and markers peak.
