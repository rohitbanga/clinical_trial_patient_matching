Last seen by PCP 1 mo ago. At that time, he had been complaining of hypoglycemia w/ sugars in the 70's causing him to feel shakey and anxious. Glyburide was stopped, Metformin dose was adjusted from 1000mg bid to 875mg tid. Today he states he has had no hypoglycemic sxs since these changes. He forgot his logbook today. Reports lowest sugar in the 80's, highest 180. Most fastings around 100, randoms 140-150's. He is still walking every day. States his back is "fine", no longer painful, though sometimes stiff upon wakening. Has appt at Promptcare for eye exam later this month.

Has gained #14 in 1 month, which he blames on increased stress at home. His cat was injured and recuperating. His mother was recently dx'd w/ "carcinoma", but he is unclear of type. He eats when he is stressed. Has not seen psych yet, but states they have been playing "phone tag". He continues to have insomnia and finds neither the Prozac or Serax helpful. Depression is stable, but not any better. Would like to change from Prozac to something else. Plans to call psych today and discuss. Denies SI/HI.

HTN managed w/ Lisinopril 40mg and HCTZ 25mg qd added last time. He is tolerating the med w/ no dizziness, CP, SOB, palps, edema.

ENDOCRINE/DIABETES STAFF CONSULTATION

Patient: VAUGHN, FRANK			MANAMANA MRN: 6767510
Requesting MD: Dr. Quale			Service: SICU

CC/ID: Asked to see this 33 y/o M admitted with Fourier's gangrene, s/p multiple surgical procedures, for DM management

HPI/ROS: Pt is a 33 y/o with DM-2 who was in his USH until about 2 weeks PTA, when he developed buttock pain.  He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.  He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.  He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.  He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.  He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.  Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.  On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.  On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.  In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.  On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.  His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.  An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.  The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.  He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.

In terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.  At the time he was feeling "lousy," tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376.  Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.  He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.  Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).  He has microalbuminuria.  He is unable to give me a full history.

In the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.  He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.

Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.

Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.

Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.  Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.  Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.

Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.

Recommend:
1. Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
2. Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
3. Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
4. Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g. Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
5. Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves

Thank you for interesting consult
Dr. Tan will follow

MANAMANA  MEDICAL  CONSULT  NOTE
PATIENT:  Vaughn, Frank R.
MANAMANA MR#:  6767510
PCP:  Henry Jenkins, M.D. (503 155-7742)
PSYCH:  Brittany Prince, M.D.
CONTACT:  Mother, Haley Vaughn (158 857-4114)
SOURCE:   Patient; M.D. Passoff; Previous Medical Records
PRECAUTIONS:   MRSA; VRE
PRIMARY SERVICE:  Psychiatry Service (Internal Medicine)
CONSULT DATE:   6/19/77
TIME:   2:00 PM
CC:  Suicidal ideation
REASON for CONSULT:  Evaluation for history of medical problems


HPI:  Pt is a 33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.  Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.  


The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.


The Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service.

ASSESSMENT
33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.  Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.  His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.  He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.  His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.  His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
2. Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.  If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
3. Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
4. No concentrated sweets diet
5. Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
6. Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
7. Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
8. Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
9. Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service


Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

Mild induration and thickening of the overlying skin of the abdominal wall is also noted. Stable postsurgical scar in the right anterior abdominal wall. Surgical sutures in the anterior abdominal wall. There is a superficial soft tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior abdominal wall, slightly larger on the current study measuring approximately 3.3 cm. There are mild degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.


Procedure note: The area of induration on the left side of the patient&#8217;s pannus was prepped with betadine. 5cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was infiltrated into the area. A 2cm incision was made over the area of fluctuance and approximately 8cc of purulent thick fluid was expressed. A culture of the abscess fluid was sent. The wound was probed gently to break up any loculations. The wound was then packed with &#188; inch dry packing tape. A dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. 


Impression/Plan: 33 year old diabetic male with history of Fournier&#8217;s gangrene s/p multiple debridements and diverting colostomy presents with recurrent cellulitis and abscess of the left side of his pannus. The abscess was drained and packed in the ED. The patient will be admitted for IV antibiotics and careful monitoring of his cellulitis.
