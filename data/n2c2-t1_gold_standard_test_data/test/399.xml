Patient Name:	Nathan Rico			

MRN:  9190908

Date:	10/20/69			



ID/CC:  49 year-old right-handed man presenting with left hemiparesis and hemineglect.



HPI: This pt has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Per his wife, in April he described left hand weakness. He stopped smoking at the time and stated that his deficit resolved. He was in his usual state of health until this evening. He last noted feeling normal after the Coyotes game, which ended at about 7:30PM. He subsequently took a nap, per his routine, and awoke at 11:00PM to ready himself for his night shift as an RN. He took a shower and noted weakness in his right arm during the shower. After, while trying to put his clothes on, he developed progressive weakness such that his arm became plegic and he was no longer able to stand. EMS was phoned and the pt arrived at the GBH ED around 11:40PM. NIH stroke scale = 12 . Pt went for CT/CTA and required sedation and intubation to tolerate scan.

DIFFERENTIAL REQUEST   RECEIVED



Imaging: CT/CTA: old right parietal infarction; occluded right internal carotid artery; thrombus in right middle cerebral artery.



EKG: NSR, 68, LAD, no ST/T changes.



Impression: 49 year-old right-handed man presenting with right MCA-distribution stroke. He has a prior right parietal stroke apparent by CT scan and an occluded right internal carotid artery. Artery-to-artery embolus from the right ICA to the right MCA represents a likely etiology for stroke in this patient.



Recommendations:

1.	Admit to CMF neurology

2.	MRI with diffusion to assess distribution of stroke and whether diffusion/perfusion mismatch is present.

3.	allow blood pressure to autoregulate, with approximate SBP goal 140-180. When scanning done, pt should be extubated and exam followed, correlated with blood pressure.

4.	consider heparin if territory of infarct is not so large as to render hemorrhage into infarction too great a risk.

Neurology Clinic Follow-up



ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections



HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.  Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.  The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.  Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.  Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.  He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.  Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.



His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.



The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.  The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.  He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.  Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.  The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.  This may represent abscess.  Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.  Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.  Patient denies fever or chills.  He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.  This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.



Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.  He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.  His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.  He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.  His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.  While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.  He cries when he tells me about this.  A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.  He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.  His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.  There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.



He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.  An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.  He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.  Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.  They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses. 



PMHx:

-stroke as above

-HTN

-hyperlipidemia

-DM



Meds:

-Zestril 5

-trazodone 150

-Avandia 4

-Glucophage 1000 bid

-insulin

-Neurontin 400 bid

-Zantac

-Lopressor 50 bid

-Dilaudid 2 tid

-Lidoderm patch to L shoulder

-Pravachol 20

-Paxil 20

-folate, B vitamins



All:  Allegra -> unknown reaction



SoHx:  Lives with daughter and female friend.  Former RN.  No substance use of any kind.



Exam:

Gen - BP 120/75.  Pulse 56 and regular.  Well-appearing.

MS - alert and fully oriented, fluent and conversant, attentive, aware of current events.  Mood is labile with crying or laughing as appropriate.

CN - PERRL, EOMI, VFF with marked left-sided visual neglect, L face droop, tongue midline, SCM strong, unable to elevate shoulder on left, facial sensation intact

Motor - 5/5 strength throughout on right, L arm flaccid with 0/5 strength throughout, L leg with 2-3/5 proximal strength, otherwise 0/5 

Sens - intact to light touch throughout with marked extinction to DSS

Reflex - brisk on the left side with upgoing toe; otherwise normal

Coord - normal FNF on the left

Gait - hemiplegic with circumduction of left leg, quite stable with cane



Imp/Plan:   s/p R MCA stroke with hemicraniectomy, recovering nicely.  Potentially infected fluid collection at site of hemicraniectomy.  No evidence of systemic infection.  Subluxation of L shoulder.

1.  Admit for neurosurgical management as discussed.  Bone prosthesis will be placed at some point in the future (when possibility of infection is definitively ruled out or treated).

2.  Should be on aspirin for stroke/MI prophylaxis, but will discuss with Dr. Bennett before starting.

3.  Continue aggressive BP/lipid management.

4.  For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs.  Patient will stop trazodone.  If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy.  Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference.  At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.

5.  Follow-up in 3 months.

Visit Note



Patient Name: RICO, NATHAN C                     

MRN: 9190908

Dictated Date: 11/23/2071                    

Dictated By: Leroy Kelly

Date of Visit: 11/23/2071



Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.  This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.  He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.  His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.  His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.  Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.  He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.  A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.  Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.  This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.  The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.



I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.  He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.  His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa. 



Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.  Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.  He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.  He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.  He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.  His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.  These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.  He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.  He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.  This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.  There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.  He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.  The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.  He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.  He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.  



He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.  He is unable to work.  His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.  He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.  



His left arm remains paralyzed.  He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.  He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.  



He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  



CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.  



On exam Nathan is well-appearing.  His hair has now grown back.  On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.  He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.  Eye contact is good.  On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.  There is a left visual field deficit.  The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  The left arm is completely plegic.  The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.  There is left-sided sensory extinction.  Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.  Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.  



We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.  Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.  I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.  There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.  Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.



Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.  Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.  I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.  We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.  If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.  If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.  



I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.  There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.  There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.  The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.  The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.  I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.  We will keep an eye on this over time.  



No other changes are indicated at the moment.  I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.
