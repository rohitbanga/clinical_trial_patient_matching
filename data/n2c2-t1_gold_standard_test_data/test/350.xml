Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.  Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.  She has no face or leg weakness.

Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.  However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.

Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.

Recommendations:
-Head and neck MRI/MRA
-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
-Continue statin.
-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 


We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano. 


Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.  This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.  Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.  Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.  


Mrs. Doss continues to do well.  She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.  She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.  Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.  She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.  Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.  


Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).  Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.  However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.  She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.  She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.  She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.  


She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.  She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.  She sometimes feels as though she has "creepy crawly things in my head," a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure.  





Meds:

Studies: 
CTA head (5/01/90): No significant interval change in the distal left A2 segment aneurysm.


Assessment and Recommendations:


58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.   She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.  We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.  The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.  If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.  However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.  Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.  


Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.  Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.  I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.  She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.  If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.  


Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.  Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.  
Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.   




Sincerely,

The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Xiang. 

Resident's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined

by me.  Please see the resident's note for details of the

patient's past medical, social, family history, review of

systems, and physical exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling and numbness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a

history of stroke and seizure in 12/2089 and a longstanding

history of diabetes who presents today with a sharp thumbtack

poking sensation in her right hand at 9:30 a.m. while driving. 

It lasted 3-4 seconds and then completely resolved.  Thirty

minutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand

for a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she

noticed it in her right foot and the toes.  She wiggles her toes

in her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then

30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation

in the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then

resolved completely.  Since then, she has had no sensation like

this.  She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet

in the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the

past.  She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness

trauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure

activity, changes in her medications, or any new medications. 

She took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,

and very well appearing.  She called her doctor's office and the

nurse told her to come to the Emergency Department to be checked.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,

seizures in the setting of a stroke in 12/2089, and a left MCA

stroke in 12/2089.  She has had no seizures since then.  She has

residual right lower extremity weakness, which is now much

improved.  Echo in 12/2089 showed an EF of 60%.  She has

concentric LVH, no wall motion abnormalities, and no other

surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past smoker of 30 pack years, ETOH none, and no

IV drug use.  She works as a Business Services Manager and lives

with her family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She takes Dilantin, glipizide, Glucophage, Plavix,

atenolol, Cozaar, and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with normal and stable

vital signs.  Awake, alert, and in no distress.  Her exam is

completely unremarkable including 5/5 strength in her upper and

lower extremities.  Gait is normal.  She has no cerebellar signs,

past pointing dysmetria, aphasia, ataxia, focal weakness, or any

focal sensory deficit at all.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows bradycardia at 50 beats a minute with

nonspecific T-wave changes.  Fingerstick is 150.  Dilantin level

is normal.  Head CT shows no evidence of bleeding or any other

abnormality.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Neurology was consulted and agrees

with the diagnosis of likely peripheral neuropathy.  They will

help arrange followup within 1 week for this patient with her

neurologist and she is told to see her primary care physician

within 2 weeks and to return to the Emergency Department for any

chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worsening of her

symptoms.

DISPOSITION:  She is well appearing at the time of discharge in

satisfactory condition.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 




We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro. 





Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.  She was last seen here in December 2091. 
Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.  Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.  However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.  



Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.  She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.  She denies any recent seizures.  After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

Assessment and Recommendations:



60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.  Her clinical examination remains intact.  She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.  Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.  Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.  Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.  If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).  After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.  She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.  



We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.  The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.  (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.  



Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     





Sincerely,
