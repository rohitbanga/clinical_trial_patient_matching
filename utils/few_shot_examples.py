MRN: 80531359 
DOV: 05/28/90 


Mr. Ocampo comes in for follow up of his hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and also wants to assess his impotence.  Mr. 
Ocampo gets only semi-erections.  He was quite depressed about this 
issue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.  His 
daughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her 
father might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant 
component of the issue.  He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or 
fainting spells.  He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or 
constipation.  Urinary symptoms are stable.  His neurological status is 
fine. He tried to lose 5 pounds by exercising and was successful.

EXAM:  On physical examination today his blood pressure is 130/74.  His 
HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His chest is clear.  His heart shows no 
murmurs.  His abdominal examination is benign.  His rectal is guaiac 
negative with a smooth prostate.  I gave him a pack of stool guaiac 
cards.  

ASSESSMENT:  I will give him a prescription of Viagra and I gave him 
appropriate patient education.  I will see him in six months.  I will 
get some laboratory tests and write him a letter.  We will be tuned 
into the issue of depression going forward.

Dear Ken:

Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.

The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.

On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.

Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.

Sincerely yours,

NAME: Ocampo, Nathan-Oliver 
MRN: 80531359 
DOV: 05/28/90 


Mr. Ocampo comes in for follow up of his hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and also wants to assess his impotence.  Mr. 
Ocampo gets only semi-erections.  He was quite depressed about this 
issue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.  His 
daughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her 
father might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant 
component of the issue.  He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or 
fainting spells.  He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or 
constipation.  Urinary symptoms are stable.  His neurological status is 
fine. He tried to lose 5 pounds by exercising and was successful.

EXAM:  On physical examination today his blood pressure is 130/74.  His 
HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His chest is clear.  His heart shows no 
murmurs.  His abdominal examination is benign.  His rectal is guaiac 
negative with a smooth prostate.  I gave him a pack of stool guaiac 
cards.  

ASSESSMENT:  I will give him a prescription of Viagra and I gave him 
appropriate patient education.  I will see him in six months.  I will 
get some laboratory tests and write him a letter.  We will be tuned 
into the issue of depression going forward.

Kenneth X. Sylvester, Jr., M.D.
Holden District Hospital
62 Ferry Road Cardiology
Foxborough, TX  58771


Dear Ken:

Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.

The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.

On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.

Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.

Sincerely yours,

                          OFFICE NOTE
                                
Lydia Levine
MR #813-25-60-5
March 20, 2076
 
Ms. Levine is a 50-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non-
insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history
of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization
for a positive stress test.  At catheterization she had a
proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA
lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of
60%.  At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on
Ms. Levine.  Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two
weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain.  She
continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d.,
atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as
well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines.
 
Physical Examination:  She is an obese, white female in no acute
distress.  Her vital signs are stable.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She has no
peripheral edema.
 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted.
 
Impression/Plan:  We will continue Ms. Levine on her current
cardiac regimen.  She has three-vessel coronary artery disease,
non-obstructive in nature.  As long as she remains asymptomatic
on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. 
She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three
months.

This patient was seen in combination with Dr. Lance Camacho.  His note reflects our joint assessment and plan.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

NAME: Ocampo, Nathan-Oliver 
MRN: 80531359 
DOV: 05/28/90 


Mr. Ocampo comes in for follow up of his hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia and also wants to assess his impotence.  Mr. 
Ocampo gets only semi-erections.  He was quite depressed about this 
issue during March, but he feels that his mood has improved.  His 
daughter, Urbina, did talk to me in the hallway about concerns that her 
father might be depressed although he feels that this was a significant 
component of the issue.  He had not had chest pain, chest pressure or 
fainting spells.  He has had no nausea, diarrhea, vomiting or 
constipation.  Urinary symptoms are stable.  His neurological status is 
fine. He tried to lose 5 pounds by exercising and was successful.

EXAM:  On physical examination today his blood pressure is 130/74.  His 
HEENT exam is unremarkable.  His chest is clear.  His heart shows no 
murmurs.  His abdominal examination is benign.  His rectal is guaiac 
negative with a smooth prostate.  I gave him a pack of stool guaiac 
cards.  

ASSESSMENT:  I will give him a prescription of Viagra and I gave him 
appropriate patient education.  I will see him in six months.  I will 
get some laboratory tests and write him a letter.  We will be tuned 
into the issue of depression going forward.

PE:   NAD.  BP R arm sitting 152/63, P 85 reg, R 14 unlabored, W 201 lbs.  Neck supple, JVP flat, carotids w/o bruits, trace R basalar rhonchi, chest otherwise clear.  Cardiac normal S1, phys split S2, I-II/VI SEM from apex to base, no DM or rub.  Abdomen benign, BS well heard, no aneurysm or bruit.  Markedly diminished peripheral pulses in both legs.  



ECG:  SR, occasional APBs at 80, 0.16/0.14/0.38, -40o.  LBBB, secondary ST T-wave changes.  



I&P:  76-yr-old man had recent exertional back discomfort that may be ischemic in origin.   Have discussed various diagnostic and therapeutic options w/pt and wife, including potential stress testing vs coronary angiography.  As he reports steady increase in frequency in exertional back pain, now w/at least 1 episode occurring at rest (in setting of multiple CRFs of HTN, dyslipidemia, significant PVD) he has agreed to undergo coronary angiography which will be arranged for tomorrow.  He will have routine blood studies and CXR today.  Results of cath will determine recommendations.

Kenneth X. Sylvester, Jr., M.D.
Holden District Hospital

Foxborough, TX  58771


Dear Ken:

Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.

The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.

On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.

Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care.

Sincerely yours,

# Current Date

Assume that the current date is: 2093-09-13

# Inclusion Criterion

The inclusion criterion being assessed is: "ADVANCED-CAD: Advanced cardiovascular disease (CAD). For the purposes of this annotation, we define “advanced” as having 2 or more of the following: (a) Taking 2 or more medications to treat CAD (b) History of myocardial infarction (MI) (c) Currently experiencing angina (d) Ischemia, past or present. The patient must have at least 2 of these categories (a,b,c,d) to meet this criterion, otherwise the patient does not meet this criterion. For ADVANCED-CAD, be strict in your evaluation of the patient -- if they just have cardiovascular disease, then they do not meet this criterion."

                          OFFICE NOTE
                                
Lydia Levine
MR #813-25-60-5
March 20, 2076
 
Ms. Levine is a 50-year-old, perimenopausal woman with non-
insulin dependent diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and a history
of tobacco use, who underwent a recent cardiac catheterization
for a positive stress test.  At catheterization she had a
proximal 60% lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 60-70% RCA
lesion, obtuse marginal lesion of 60%, and an LAD mid lesion of
60%.  At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on
Ms. Levine.  Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two
weeks ago, she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain.  She
continues on her medicines including Lopid 500 mg b.i.d.,
atenolol, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed, as
well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines.
 
Physical Examination:  She is an obese, white female in no acute
distress.  Her vital signs are stable.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation.  Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She has no
peripheral edema.
 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70,
axis of about 46, and there are no acute ST-T changes noted.
 
Impression/Plan:  We will continue Ms. Levine on her current
cardiac regimen.  She has three-vessel coronary artery disease,
non-obstructive in nature.  As long as she remains asymptomatic
on her current medical regimen, we will continue to follow her. 
She will return for a follow-up visit in approximately three
months.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, Ms. Levin is a 54-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who has known coronary artery disease.  She had an exercise test in 2076 for some vague symptoms, which was positive, and led to cardiac catheterization.  This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion.  She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms.  She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic.  She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion.  She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol.  She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate.  At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort.  She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is mildly obese white female.  She has no jugular venous distention.  Her carotids are 2+.  Her heart shows normal S1 and S2.  There is a 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities show no cyanosis or edema.  Electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis and intervals.  There is no evidence of ischemia or infarction.

ASSESSMENT:  Ms. Levin is a 55-year-old diabetic woman with progressive anginal symptoms with known moderate 3-vessel coronary artery disease from 4 years ago with at least moderate risk, positive stress test.  After discussion with Dr. Camacho, our plan will be continue her on aspirin, beta-blocker, and a low-dose ACE inhibitor through her regimen.  She refuses to take a cholesterol-lowering agent due to previous concerns with myalgias.  She will be referred for cardiac catheterization within the next several days with a goal to better define her coronary anatomy for the possibility of percutaneous coronary intervention versus cardiac bypass surgery.

reviewed all data from recent hospitalization

Assessment - cardiovascular status - stable

r/o peripheral artery disease

Plan influenza vaccine per RN

samples dispensed of zetia for 6 weeks. will check fasting lipids and ALT. if effective, will contact her insurance for prior authorization

# Current Date

Assume that the current date is: 2093-09-13

# Inclusion Criterion

The inclusion criterion being assessed is: "ADVANCED-CAD: Advanced cardiovascular disease (CAD). For the purposes of this annotation, we define “advanced” as having 2 or more of the following: (a) Taking 2 or more medications to treat CAD (b) History of myocardial infarction (MI) (c) Currently experiencing angina (d) Ischemia, past or present. The patient must have at least 2 of these categories (a,b,c,d) to meet this criterion, otherwise the patient does not meet this criterion. For ADVANCED-CAD, be strict in your evaluation of the patient -- if they just have cardiovascular disease, then they do not meet this criterion."
